            Ultimate Hiring Criteria</font></b><br>
            How do we set hiring criteria? Should companies spell out their hiring 
            criteria or leave the criteria unknown to the interviewer. Do most 
            companies even have set criteria? Some companies assign their related 
            departments to develop the hiring criteria for themselves, and it 
            is sometimes left to the individual executives to interpret hiring 
            parameters for themselves. Many interviewers are not experts, and 
            this is evident by their questions' lack of direction. Without direction 
            the interviewer will never have enough applicable information, or 
            pertinent information, to make the right decision. <br>
            <br>
            Setting hiring criteria is not easy. Every company desires high caliber 
            employees, but how do they make their hiring decisions? Some companies 
            are overwhelmed with too many hiring criteria: can their criteria 
            be concrete ones? According to my notes from February 10, 1994, I 
            set up hiring criteria to include leadership, responsibility, ambition 
            and drive, energy, ability to handle pressure, teamwork, vision, depth 
            of conviction and, of course, personal worth--is the employee a good 
            person?</font></td>

            It was not, and still is not, easy to answer so many questions. By 
            1996 we had distilled our list down to three focused criteria: <b>Drive 
            to be successful on the highest level; Present and future talent; 
            and Attitude towards people, their job and their environment. </b>These 
            three areas must be covered to the interviewer's satisfaction. Otherwise, 
            the employer will have to wait until someone manages to demonstrate 
            themselves in these areas.<br>
            <br>
            <b><font size="3">Drive to be successful </font></b><br>
            In our experience, we have learned that one's drive to be successful 
            can be an indicator of how far that person can go. Drive directs everything 
            in life. People can be nearly anything if they have enough drive to 
            be so. Many seemingly impossible tasks have been accomplished because 
            of a strong drive to do so. Humans have been to the moon and moved 
            mountains because they had the drive to do it. 
            <p>If we take a look at successful people, we will see that their 
              success stems from their foundation, which is drive. They are inspired 
              to be somebody or do something. Becoming what you want to become 
              is often a journey that begins as a little boy or girl. Having drive 
              gives one the power to push people further. It takes drive to survive 
              and triumph in the toughest situations. </p>
            <p>During the past sixteen years, we have seen many of the most talented 
              people fail simply because they didn't have enough drive to reach 
              their destinations. We have also seen cases of people who survive 
              even though they were perhaps not very talented. But their drive 
              got them through and helped them develop the required talent to 
              be successful. That is why when hiring staff, we check whether the 
              individual's drive is strong and matched with our company's objective 
              and culture.<br>
              <br>
              <b><font size="3">Present and Future talent</font></b><br>
              Talent is one's capacity for accomplishment. We desire the most 
              talented people so that we can grow faster than the industry. We 
              need people suited for the long run. We should take every step to 
              obtain as many qualified resumes as possible so that we have a larger 
              pool to select from. The top successful applicants will fill a position.<br>
              However, some companies feel that they are inferior to larger, or 
              better-known, companies and cannot attract a large number of qualified 
              applicants. Likewise, sometimes prominent companies are misled by 
              believing that they will get the most talented applicants simply 
              because of their reputation. <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>We do not rank companies on a scale based on profits. We believe 
              that, like people, companies are fundamentally equal and may be 
              ranked more appropriately by the quality of life that they create 
              for their employees. Large, stable, reputable companies are only 
              that way because of their stockholders--it has nothing to do with 
              their employees if they do not focus on bettering their employee's 
              quality of life. The underlying question that should be addressed 
              is this: <b>What is the quality of life of each company's employees?</b> 
              We do not compare employees on an individual basis according to 
              income, and this applies to the entire company as well. Everyone 
              desires and deserves happiness no matter for which company that 
              employee works. It is up to the company's Human Resource Policy 
              to ensure the quality of life for its employees. <br>
              <br>
              <b><font size="3">Back to Criteria…</font></b><br>
              Achievement is the benchmark in judging talent. There really should 
              not be any other test but to test for talent. We believe a four-year 
              grading system should be adequate. Higher grades show one's ability 
              to understand, analyze and organize as well as one's level of responsibility. 
              During four years of studying, students take, on average, more than 
              50 exams. This is enough to measure real talent as they were on 
              their own and not tested only under a single specific circumstance. 
              For those with work experience, their achievement in the workplace 
              counts and is more important to us than total years of experience. 
              Achievement can indicate how far a person may develop. Future development 
              is also important. We are not looking simply at the talent they 
              currently possess, but at their potential as well.</p>
            <p>During an interview session, we try to let the applicants sell 
              themselves. We give them a chance to describe themselves, and tell 
              us why they should be chosen to work for our company. We do not 
              believe in standardized tests or incoming exams because tests cannot 
              judge what a candidate is able and willing to contribute to any 
              significant degree. We want them to give us a picture of themselves 
              as they see themselves because they should be more capable of this 
              than anyone. <b>Unfortunately, most applicants are not prepared 
              for such questions. It takes time to develop an answer. </b><br>
              <br>
              <b><font size="3">Attitudes toward people, job and environment</font></b><br>
              Attitude is the navigator of one's life. All of our decisions are 
              based on the way we understand people, our job and our environment. 
              Talent is important, but it is our attitude that controls the direction 
              in which we place our talent. Sometimes talented people fail simply 
              because they do not have a good attitude to keep them directed on 
              the right course.</p>
            <p>Talented people are easier to find than people with a good attitude. 
              Sometime the most talented people are not the best suited for a 
              position because they may have other issues that become evident 
              in the workplace, such as satisfying their ego, among other things. 
              Having an excellent attitude is a must, and it is often a good indicator 
              of heart.<br>
              <br>
              Sometimes we can find those with a good attitude by observing their 
              hobbies and interests. But another important place for observation 
              is that of their relationships with friends and coworkers. By hiring 
              employees with a good attitude, a company will reduce conflict and 
              unnecessary politics substantially.</p>
            <p>When compared to drive and talent, attitude carries more weight. 
              This is because a person of the right attitude will impress the 
              interviewer--we welcome the person with whom we feel we can work.
