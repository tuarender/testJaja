            Top Gun has been in the advertising and marketing business since 1986. 
            Our rate of growth is derived from our attention to human resources 
            policies and recruitment strategies. We examine a large number of 
            candidates as many as 6,000 for employment each year. Based on this 
            experience we have developed strong recruiting and training systems, 
            as well as organizational activities, to find the best employees and 
            provide them with the best quality of life possible.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#006586"><br>

            We are a service company; therefore, our most important resource are 
            our human resources. We have put serious attention into our human 
            resources ever since</font></td>

            we started our business. We started our business with a task force 
            or labor level adequate to managing our taxi-based advertising projects. 
            Most of our people did not possess a bachelor's degree. Our only solid 
            resource was employees with heart and drive to be the best. <br>
            <br>
            In late 1990, Top Gun needed someone to manage the accounting system. 
            We consulted with Price Waterhouse and decided to hire a senior accounting 
            manager (MBA with 5 years experience). It was our turning point. This 
            human resource move led us to increased efficiency and a better system 
            of business. Accounting is the basis foundation for every system of 
            the company. Updating our accounting by hiring the right employee 
            has had a big impact on our company's work procedure on a daily basis.<br>
            <br>
            In 1991, we made another big move. It was an event because we hired 
            our first employee who possessed a bachelor's degree. This was critical 
            because he was very talented graduate from a top business school, 
            which was very controversial among the operating level. They believed 
            that a new hire with a bachelor's degree would not be tough enough 
            to handle the hours and workload. However, he turned out to be our 
            first Special Projects Manager and initiated and established our Human 
            Resources Department in 1992. We changed our company's environment 
            to fit the most talented persons. Since then, all our new hires have 
            possessed at least a bachelor's degree. And a few years later, the 
            rest of the world would call this process, reengineering.<br>
            <br>
            In 1994, we hired another top level executive, this time from an ad 
            agency. This was another big step for our client services department. 
            The company started to decentralize and the office began to take on 
            a truly professional atmosphere. At this point we were finally able 
            to attract graduates from the United States.<br>
            <br>
            In 1996, we developed new concepts in human resource policy. We implemented 
            a &quot;home and office&quot; concept: work professionally, but feel 
            at home. We had many breakthrough projects that year just because 
            we had continued to improve our human resources. Our training and 
            development programs are unique. We initiated our &quot;individual 
            development program,&quot; which was tailored to fit the needs of 
            each individual in our company. We started our &quot;Romance of Three 
            Kingdoms @ Work&quot; seminar, which we believe will be one of the 
            world's best human resource seminars in the future. Our company's 
            philosophy is centered on this concept: Good Heart, Work Hard, Struggle 
            to Enjoy Life. <br>
            <br>
            In 2001, everyone in Top Gun can play golf, the majority of employees 
            listen to classical music or even play a musical instrument, some 
            have learned to sail, some can scuba dive, most play chess, some do 
            bird watching and star watching…and much more. This is life and this 
            is Top Gun. We are moving toward a new era of international challenge.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#006586">
