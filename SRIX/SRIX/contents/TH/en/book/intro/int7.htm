            Human resource executives will pay more attention to the programs 
            that develop employee skills in applying knowledge and problem solving. 
            <p>Simple seminars are not always the best, or only, ways to improve 
              work efficiency and train employees. These seminars just dispense

              need such information to improve efficiency or self-development. 
              After four years of college, and perhaps two years for a MBA, most 
              problems regarding skilled application of knowledge and problem 
              solving should be addressed.

            Performance evaluation is a problem when we are deciding salary for 
            individuals (both new hires as well as current employees that deserve 
            a raise in salary). And a normal evaluation form is usually tailored 
            very poorly for individuals. Many forms are based on theory, not practice, 
            because they go on about little things and put too much weight on 
            the individual weaknesses of employees. Every person is not perfect, 
            but every person can be evaluated and that person's strength can be 
            discovered. Strengths and weaknesses are the principles of this issue. 
            <p>After more than 16 years of developing people, I have learned that 
              people have different strengths and weaknesses. And this is what 
              counts, especially in terms of performance. Strength is a reason 
              that a person succeeds, and weakness is a reason that a person fails.

              In 1996, two programs: Romance of Three Kingdoms @ Work and IDP 
              (Individual Development Program run by Top Gun Company members). 
              Flagship programs are now very successful in our human resource 
              development.<b> They allow the company to learn to identify what 
              types of strengths really made people successful and what type of 
              weaknesses really holds people from success. Future resume need 
              to convey the strengths of the applicant, so that job seekers can 
              present themselves as accurately as possible. Likewise, employers

              of Three Kingdoms @ Work contributes by conveying strengths that

            <p>Based on the assumption that if an employee has the qualities of 
              an entrepreneur, he or she will contribute to the company's progress 
              more than being only a professional. The entrepreneur's characteristics 
              can also help the employee to build his own life in a more successful 
              way in the future. The first visual experience in the Romance of 
              Three Kingdoms @ Work video gives the background of the kingdom's 
              foundation, which has similarities to events replaceable in our 
              era. In Romance of Three Kingdoms @ Work, Sun Ce used his bravery 
              and courage on the battlefield as such to form his group. This continued 
              through the Sun Quan Period like a heritage from one's parents. 
              As for Cao Cao, his outstanding advantage was his skill in professional 
              management. For Liu Bei, his strong point was his virtue, which 
              encouraged able people to devote themselves and work with him. Entrepreneurs 
              should consider these great men's ideas, decisions and characteristics 
              in terms of strength.
            <p>Romance of Three Kingdoms @ Work depicts more practical administration 
              patterns than modern management. By &quot;practical,&quot; we mean 
              those principles, which can be put into use right away, <br>
              unlike western management theories. All theories are usually for 
              classroom use or to account for failure or success. What one gets 
              out of these theories is what the supply and demand lines mean, 
              but we know that in reality these lines cannot be drawn up. We understand 
              what centralization and decentralization mean, but we do not know 
              when to use which in order to succeed. The difference between an 
              academic and a practical person is that the former focuses on explanation, 
              while a practical person focuses on the real thing, conditioned 
              by situations. Romance of Three Kingdoms @ Work presents thought-provoking 
              lessons, which require serious thought, rather than mere understanding. 
              Different events and conditions lead to different kinds of decisions 
              and of course to different impacts and effects. The novel does not 
              involve explanation: you must conclude what can be put into practice 
              for yourself.<br>
              <br>
              To get ahead of others, you should have the ability to analyze. 
              You must formulate your own theory rather than trying to understand 
              and follow the old ones. What really matters now is the pace of 
              business and ever changing situations and conditions. By the time 
              an academic knows what has happened, or comes up with a theory, 
              the world has progressed. If you think for yourself and solve problems, 
              new theories will come to you, since every theory stems from problem 
              solving. Romance of Three Kingdoms @ Work invites you to let your 
              thoughts go with the conditions of situations. You should be able 
              to develop reasonable thoughts, see where the problem lies, and 
              attack the problem. <br>

            <p>It is always a tough time when I have to consider raising my staff's 
              salary. Salary should be based on the value of each person's market 
              value, as well as with his/her relation to the rest of the staff. 
              The value of an employee usually refers to talent or ability to 
              accomplish projects, their level of experience and their contribution 
              to the company.</p>
            <p>Some guidelines from the human resources market can be obtained, 
              but it is still a tough decision to decide. I ask my staff, &quot;Why 
              do you think you're a more valuable employee this year and will 
              contribute more to the company so that the company can give you 
              a higher salary?&quot; We use this idea as an opportunity to explain 
              ourselves on this point so that we can come up with a mutually agreed 
              evaluation. <br>
              <br>
              I am in the position to help everyone get his or her raise. So I 
              do my best to help them. In 1996, I came up with our Individual 
              Development Program (IDP). This program helps reveal a specific 
              direction for each individual to develop. <b>Our IDP is based on 
              the thinking that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses 
              and needs to develop different areas. This program is not designed 
              to correct small mistakes, but to correct the root of the mistake. 
              Or in other words: we try to correct the cause of failure or barriers 
              from success. The strengths that each person possesses need to be 
              consciously retained and developed because they are the routes to 
              that person's success. </b> A weakness is something that prevents 
              them from further success. So they need focus and attention. Each 
              person can only correct or develop a few things each year. <b>Strengths 
              and weaknesses are not things that you can develop right away. It 
              is a lot like playing golf: no matter how good the golf pro's advice, 
              it takes months and years to finally play according to that advice.</b><br>
            </p>
            </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#006586">Our 
            method of correcting weaknesses is also unique. We use piano lessons 
            to help a person who has trouble with details and accuracy. We have 
            a two- person lunch program for people who need to develop interpersonal 
            skills; the person who has trouble in social situations will ask different 
            colleagues to lunch in order to develop this skill, and all the office 
            employees will help. We designed a program to help with supervisory 
            abilities by having those employees tell a story in a loud voice every 
            morning to improve their management abilities. Those who lack strategic 
            thinking are assigned to play Chinese Chess. This technique has met 
            with highly positive results. We always try to set up a medium or 
            program to help, not just to criticize. A person who is too shy to 
            comment on coworkers is assigned to criticize his boss every morning. 
            We follow this pattern until these employees can give their opinions 
            and comments without hesitation. All of these programs have been developed 
            to help employees cope with weakness and find their strengths. </font></td>
