            Resume: The Information Management of the future</font></b><br>
            The Super Resume is normally a one-page format resume. The designed 
            information in the Super <br>
            Resume is limited but efficient information to present job seekers 
            and for screening candidates for the interview session. The information 
            in the Super Resume is grouped under future unique hiring criteria; 
            Inspiration &amp; drive, Talent, and Attitude. The Super Resume will 
            help the job seekers present themselves better than general/ traditional 
            resumes. And at the same time, help the human resources executives 
            to screen candidates more effectively for interview sessions. The 
            Super Resume will treat resume to be two different parts; the Super 
            Resume itself which will be utilized for screening for the interview 
            selection, and the Super Resume Attachment which will be utilized 
            during the job interview session in order to complete the information 
            for final hiring purpose. </font></td>

            The Super Resume is superior in presenting job seekers' Inspiration 
            &amp; Drive through; career objective, job field wanted, target industry 
            wanted. Better in presenting Talent through; strength, interests and 
            hobbies. Better in presenting Attitude through; the relation of education, 
            activities, part-time employment, full-time working experience vs. 
            strengths and interest and hobbies.<br>
            <br>
            The Super Resume will improve the recruitment process. The HR executive 
            will save time and costs in screening as the Super Resume will normally 
            be in one-page. The screening process will not overwhelm with information, 
            there is still need for the interview selection. Imagine the resumes 
            come from hundreds and thousands of candidates, if we cannot control 
            the quanity of information, the screening process is not efficient. 
            Moreover, the new technique in presenting Strength and Interests and 
            Hobbies portions will provide much better information to select the 
            right persons for interview session.<br>

            a resume comes in one report for total recruitment process. However, 
            the Super Resume is divided into two groups of information that will 
            be used for different purposes as to the different recruitment process; 
            a) Super Resume main information is used to apply for job for an interview 
            session, b) Super Resume attachment is used for final hiring. Generally, 
            a resume comes as a total report which causes an overload of information 
            especially the information that is not necessary for the process of 
            selection for an interview. Super Resume helps to solve this problem 
            by designing the process into two steps.</font></td>

            The multiple choice in Super Resume is a new multiple choices technique 
            that is used to improve the interpretation of the information. Normally, 
            multiple choice is used with the purpose of finding the right answer 
            which we usually find in the test or exam such as &quot;The sun starts 
            to rise from a) North, or b) South, or c) East, or d) West. Or used 
            with the purpose of facilitation by providing the answer which we 
            normally find in the case of completing forms such as &quot;how is 
            your English; a) good, b) fair, c) poor. Some multiple choice can 
            have more than one answer such as &quot;what colors do you like? a) 
            Yellow, or b) Red, or c) Green. The above two purposes and three examples 
            are all trying to find out the right answer that is/are chosen. And 
            they are not looking to the answers that are not chosen. However; 
            in Super Resume, our multiple choice is designed with the purpose 
            of trying to interpret the information that are not chosen beside 
            the information that are chosen. The Super Resume is design to interpret 
            another side of the coin. For example; </font></td>

            In the Super Resume, choosing 5 strengths out of 74, can imply that 
            the unchosen 69 strengths are the list of weakness, or list of strengths 
            that the job seekers might not have. If a person chooses 1) Friendly, 
            2) Pleasant personality, 3) Service minded, 4) Good at heart, and 
            5) patient, <b>he/she can be a good salesperson.</b> And the special 
            design list of multiple choice allows us to define the scope of strength 
            to work with. It allows us to treat the unchosen list of strengths 
            such as Analytical, Organized/Systematic, Strategic thinking, Able 
            to delegate responsibilities, as weaknesses and leads us to the interpretation 
            that <b>that person may not be good in a management position.</b> 
            However; the human resource executive must not judge the candidate 
            right away but re-check/reconfirm during the two ways communication 
            in the interview session. </font></td>

          <td width="422" height="121"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#006586">Another 
            example is in the Interest and Hobbies section, the multiple choice 
            is designed to get the answer that are chosen, and at the same time, 
            the list of the multiple choice design the scope of Interests and 
            Hobbies to work with. Therefore; the purpose is also emphasis on the 
            choice that are not chosen in order to be able to make further interpretation. 
            If a person chooses swimming as his/her only interest and hobbies, 
            we are certain that he/she has gone through the list of Interests 
            and Hobbies and intentionally not chosen other choice, this is to 
            define the scope of choosing and not choosing. Therefore, we might 
            interpret more about that person in the way that he/she might not 
            be comfortable to play, like a team-works such as basketball, football, 
            volleyball. Or that person might not be comfortable with adventure 
            or taking risk as he/she does not choose any outdoor adventure such 
            as Scuba Diving, Sailing, Mountain Biking etc. The human resource 
            department then has information to access more, or re-check for further 
            clarification in case of doubt during the two way communication in 
            the interview session. </font></td>

            be no more or no less on the ingredients. Otherwise, it will not come 
            out delicious. In the Super Resume, because the one-page resume is 
            essential, precise and limited information is a must. The Super Resume 
            will not allow a candidate to give more than two steps of his latest 
            educational background. It does not allow one to give more than one 
            history of school/university activity. One is also not allowed to 
            give more than two records of part-time jobs, or more than two records 
            of full-time jobs. And giving more than two personal references is
