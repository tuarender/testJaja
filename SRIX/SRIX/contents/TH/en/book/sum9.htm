        interests and hobbies. They come in multiple choice just to make sure 
        that the candidates will cover them all in their resume. This allows candidates 
        to give accurately the overall picture of what they have been through. 
        And the HR executive can see more clearly from their favorite interests 
        and hobbies that the candidates rank their top 5 favorite activities.<br>
Interests and Hobbies of a person are just like a jigsaw puzzle that will 
        draw personality and attitude. It is better than any psychological test 
        in the sense that they are the real enjoyment on which people spend time. 
        They take months and years to shape up people, not like taking a very 
        short psychological test. In taking the test, people just use their brain 
        to choose the right answer. It might not be true when applying to the 
        real world. Moreover, some psychological tests just explain who is that 
        person by describing in words, just like a fortune teller can tell who 
        you are. And most of the time, it cannot be an accurate way to know a 
        person. </font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>

        of a jigsaw. They draw a picture which sometimes can/cannot be described 
        in words. But based on experience of HR executives, they will develop 
        perception of a person and can expect a certain attitude and personality. 
        And no matter how the candidates mislead the HR executives in some area, 
        their interests and hobbies will tell the truth.</font></font><br>
        Our company is using interest and hobbies as self-development tools and medium. We use them to develop employees' vision by exposing them through many "enjoy life" activities. They enjoy taking part in these activities, which aim to train and develop employees' working and personal life. They will work more efficiently and learn to live with enjoyment. The following are some examples that demonstrate how we can read people through their interests and hobbies.</font><br>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#006586"><font size="5"><font size="2"><b><font size="3">Music</font></b><br>
Music is sophisticated and is a fundamental art. It comes from the environment 
      that inspires human life. Vocal song is an easy type of self-expression. 
      We have tendency to love songs that express our emotion or life. Listening 
      or singing is the way to express one's attitude and philosophy. By the types 
      of music that the candidates listen to, we have pieces of jigsaws to know 
      how sophisticated those candidates are. For example; people who listen to 
      pop song are more likely to be an average people. People who listen to rock 
      music will be more aggressive in expressing self, more direct, and down 
      to earth. Alternative songs will be more likely to attract contemporary 
      and young generation people. People who listen to Jazz will be more sophisticated, 
      calm and harmonious. People who listen to classical music are more likely 
      to be very sophisticated ones. The classical music usually has no words 
      to help express ideas. The beauty of the classical music is purely in its 
      melody. The composition of notes, structure, pattern, rhythm etc. inspires 
      the listener and the musician.<br>
We have learned from our Classical Music Appreciation Course, taken by our 
      employees. And learned from employees who play some musical instruments. 
      And we even use music as a tool or medium to correct weakness and build 
      up strength in our human resource development. The inspiration of a player 
      will be deeper than the one who is just a listener. People who play music 
      are more active and not passive. They tend to be calm, kind-hearted, doers, 
      careful, and patient enough to wait as they play from note to note, etc. 
      This can be the foundation of their vision and shape a person to be a good 
      decision-maker in the future.<br>
Type of musical instruments can also tell the character of a person. All 
      types of instruments require a lot of hard-work and practice; however, they 
      all have their unique way of practise.Types of music may fit into different 
      types of instruments. For example; pop, rock, country music is usually for 
      guitar. Saxophone is usually for Jazz. Piano and violin are mostly played 
      by the classical musicians. In order to be more accurate in reading people, 
      HR executives may have to make use of music and musicians. It is difficult 
      to teach in theory but we have to learn it through experience.<br>
      <br>
      <b><font size="3">Sport</font></b><br>
We can predict right away that a person is healthy if he/she plays sports 
      consistently. These people are health -conscious, competitive, active, alert, 
      and often team- spirited etc. However, each sport shapes up the player differently. 
      According to our unique enjoy life program, we try to use sport as one of 
      the tools to develop self and increase individual's vision. The following 
      are some examples of sports with which some HR executives may not be familiar. 
      It can be seen that candidates who take some particular sport are interesting 
      persons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Golf</b><br>
Nowadays, everyone in our company is able to play golf. And new employees 
      have to learn to play golf in order to pass the probation. The concept behind 
      this is to push employees to be alert and progress in their own lives. Employees' 
      lifestyles has tremendous effect on the quality of their working performance. 
      Golf is one of the world's famous management sport. Golf will teach us to 
      know ourselves, know to control our temper, know how to make good decisions 
      in the golf game, know how to control ourselves when losing , and get back 
      to normal pace, etc. It is quite difficult to learn and play golf. Altogether, 
      people will go through tough times in learning before it can increase their 
      vision. Moreover, golf helps in making new friends and new social group, 
      which will be benefit an employees' future business connection. Some people 
      believe that golf is a mental game in which we play with ourselves. We will 
      try to control ourselves to finish the 18 holes and make it as good a game 
      as possible facing tough physical conditions under the hot sun in Thailand. 
      Golf players are always result- oriented and like to take challenges.<br>
      <b>Scuba Diving</b><br>
The thrill of exploring the mysteries of the underwater world is very challenging 
      and adventurous. Scuba diving can be a matter of life and death. The divers 
      need to learn their physical and environmental limitations and manage them 
      to discover the joys of diving. Proper instruction and training are important. 
      The rewards of safe diving allow the diver to see and feel more than an 
      average person can. People who can scuba dive are considered to be calm 
      and stable, adventurous, and able to take risk. Most of them are nature 
      lovers, people who think more than just self and share their love with species 
      other than humans.<br>
      <b>Sailing</b><br>
People who can control external force will be more successful. Sailing is 
      the use of such external forces as wind and sea to move a sail boat. It 
      is not just a muscular activity but the courage inside the sailor that is 
      vital. The reward of a good sailor is to be able to control and balance 
      the force of nature, even under chaotic situations.<br>
People who can sail are considered to be adventurous, patient, and can live 
      harmoniously with nature. People who sail often can learn to be still when 
      there is no wind. They can be patient enough to wait for the right moment 
      to come. Because of the unpredictable nature and the adventure that they 
      need to go through, they are trained to be brave in taking risk. Sometimes, 
      courage is required in making good decisions in the business environment. 
      The Internal force is easier to control and manage but external force is 
      something that we have to learn to deal with. And people who can think and 
      make use of macro-environment will have bigger vision and success. The sport 
      will shape up the player through time and inculcate in their character, 
      drive, talent and attitude.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chess</b><br>
People who play chess can gain the quality of a strategic thinker. We use 
      chess as a medium to develop employees' strategic thinking skills. Chinese 
      Chess, for example, composes of 16 units for each side. One movement will 
      effect another 31 units. The person who plays chess will not take a one 
      -side plan. They will consider the competitive move, and other detailed 
      conditions. They think about counter action, see things as a big picture. <br>
      <b>Other sports and outdoor activities</b><br>
Above are just some examples of special sports that a few people play. Ordinary 
      sport such as swimming, badminton, tennis, football, and volleyball etc. 
      can be very meaningful. We check whether the candidates are good team players, 
      or independent, or both, based on the sports they like to play. The future 
      HR executives have to be open to as many interests and hobbies by themselves 
      so that they can actual feel and read people.<br>
      <br>
      <font size="4"><b><font size="3">Ranking favorite interests and hobbies</font></b></font><br>
The more people are open to various hobbies, the more it shows how much 
      they are open to life. However, in order to be able to know their precise 
      personality, drive, talent, and attitude, the ranking of their favorite 
      will provide a bigger picture. Test this with your close friends. You will 
      know them more!</font></font></font><br>
