I believe preparation is better than cure. In undergoing a project, I feel that in order to have real success one must anticipate the problems or issues that might occur. For example, in my last building development project, we had quality issues with some of the materials that we used. As a result, we had to strip parts of the building down, setting our completion date back by two weeks. Luckily, we had three backup suppliers on queue, who were able to get us the materials we needed in twenty-four hours. Because of this skillful and thoughtful planning, we were able to finish the building only three days behind schedule rather than the two weeks we had originally anticipated.

In my past three years in the public relations department of my company I have been required to hone my planning skills. Much of what I do requires me to collaborate with people from other departments, facilitating communication among them and making sure we are all on the same page while working on a large project. I have disciplined myself to set and adhere to deadlines, and have learned how to keep others on task during a project.
