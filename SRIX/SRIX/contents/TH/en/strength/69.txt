<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I believe that people will listen to you if you listen to them. Because of this, I make it a point to listen to people’s concerns. This is especially helpful when someone has a problem with my management style. One time a coworker came to me and complained because I was doing something that was bothering her. When she came to me with her concern, I stopped what I was doing to listen. Once I made sure that I understood what she was concerned about I made changes immediately.  She has since been very happy with me.

Listening is an important skill in any business setting. When working with clients, I always stay attentive to their requests and feedback so that I know how I can best serve them. And when I am with my colleagues and superiors, I am just as attentive so that I know how I can help them in their projects or improve my performance in the office. If I did not listen to the input of those I encounter every day, I would not be nearly as successful in my work.
