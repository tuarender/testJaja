<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am good at coordinating and following up on assignments from other agencies or customers. For example, I collaborated with people for invoice issuance, which is a difficult job because of the lack of customers' information.  Together we compiled a list of duties to complete assignments.   Coordinating and following up on assignments makes my job easier and improves the overall quality of our service.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
In my position as a managing editor of the features section of a large business magazine, I have extensive experience with coordinating and following up on assignments. Essentially, my sole responsibility is to assign articles to our writers and ensure that they submit them on deadline. Working with the rest of the editorial staff, I determine what articles will be needed for each issue, decide which reporter is best suited to each topic, and then make sure each article is available in time for publication. With a staff of over 50 journalists, keeping tabs on each assignment is a challenging task, but I have managed to complete it successfully and efficiently for the past six years.
