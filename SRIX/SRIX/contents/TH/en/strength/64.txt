I think the key to success is having a good strategy. One must plan for everything that may come along the way to make sure that they will succeed and be advantageous. In our last big marketing push, I came up with a plan to undercut the competition. Instead of just selling the finished product, we would sell parts, do-it-yourself kits, and repair services directly at the venue where the action would take place rather than at retailers. This would bring the product directly to the customer rather than wait for the customer to seek the product out. Within six weeks, we were the leader in sales for the item as well as accessories and services associated with it.

In the sales department of my company, my coworkers and I are responsible for not only maintaining relationships with existing customers, but also establishing connections with new ones as well. These duties involve many external meetings, and much of our time each day is spent commuting between office buildings throughout the city. My supervisor recently asked me to devise a strategy to reduce travel times and increase the productivity of our work days. By reviewing our client lists, I created a system that makes it easier to coordinate meetings with clients in nearby office centers, thereby reducing travel times and increasing the department’s efficiency.
