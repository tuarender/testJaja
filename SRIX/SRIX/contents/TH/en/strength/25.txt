<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I love to talk to people. It helps me practice my communication skills, which I think is very important in the business world. As a salesperson, I explain to potential customers clearly the functions and benefits of our products. I also help my coworkers understand the company’s more complicated products. Having good communication skills helps me understand the customer’s needs develop programs according to the customer’s requirements. The customers then opt for my products.

Being able to communicate effectively with others is an essential component of my current sales position. I am responsible for finding new clients for my company, which sells high-tech fiber optic equipment. Many times my clients may not fully understand all the technical aspects of our products, and it is my responsibility to communicate this complex information in a simple and persuasive manner. In addition, I must also listen to my clients, understand their needs, and do my best to meet them. When I am able to connect with a client this way, then I successfully complete a sale. During my five years with the company, I have been able to strengthen this skill, and am currently the leading salesperson in my department.
