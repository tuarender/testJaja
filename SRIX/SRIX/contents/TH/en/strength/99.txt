<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I believe in doing things because they are right, even if I do not end do up being advantageous. One time a colleague of mine did extraordinary work on a project. Because we look very similar, I was falsely awarded for her work. I knew that taking credit for work that I didn’t do was wrong. So I told my boss that I did not do it and told him who did.  She was subsequently awarded for her work and it made her very happy.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Throughout my career in the corporate world, I have encountered many companies and individual supervisors who seem to abandon basic human principles in favor of making a profit. They will treat their employees unfairly, or will give biased advice to or conceal information from clients in order to earn their business. I firmly believe in certain principles, such as kindness, fairness and equality, and I’ve never abandoned them for material gain. In the past, I have filed complaints with companies, and once I was even forced to leave a position to defend my beliefs. Today, as a manager in my company, I make it a priority to stick to my principles when dealing with my staff.
