<u><b>Example1</b></u>

I hate making mistakes because they make me feel foolish. This is why I am careful in everything that I do. As a human being I know that I will always make some bad calls, but if I take care to prevent them, I will maintain a good reputation. In my last project, I had to give a presentation on the progress of company sales. I spent several late nights at my office making sure that all of my materials and information were perfect. Checking the data and rechecking them made me feel certain that my peers would respect my work. After a successful presentation, I was commended on my performance. No one knew the long hours I had spent preparing, but the time spent was well worth the praise I received.

Throughout my career as an accountant, I have always made it a point to go through my work carefully, ensuring that every detail is correct and each project is completed on time.  If I miss a detail or incorrectly calculate something in the company's financial record, that could lead to large budgeting problems or a negative review from the company's external auditors. For the same reasons, I must always complete my work on time by the end of each fiscal year. The company's ability to run smoothly depends on my careful handling of its finances, and I take my job very seriously.
