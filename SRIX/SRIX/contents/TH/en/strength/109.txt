<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
My colleagues like me because it seems as though I never fail. In reality, I just have a crowning philosophy that if I can conceive of it then I can do it. Because of this, I do not quit until I have achieved my objective. Last year, for example, we received a project that came with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The particular materials the client wanted were out of stock, there were quality issues with the original design, and they want a finished prototype by the next week. I told the client that it would be done. My coworkers thought I was crazy. But I spent long hours on the phone making sure that everything would end smoothly and motivated my team. With the combined effort of everyone, the deadline was met and the client was satisfied. I believe that there is absolutely nothing that I cannot do if I put my mind into it.

When I am assigned a task at work, I will accept it and do everything I can to complete it successfully. For example, once my coworkers and I were responsible for preparing a presentation that my boss needed ready by the next day. It was a large task that some of the others said was impossible, but I convinced my coworkers to stay working through the night in order to complete it. We ended up completing the project successfully, and demonstrated to our boss that we are dedicated to our work.
