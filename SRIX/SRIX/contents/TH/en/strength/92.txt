One thing that drives me crazy is the fact that there could be someone out there who is better than me at what I do. This is why I am constantly trying to make myself better. During our last sales push, I spent several hours practicing my approach, working up leads, and documenting my mistakes. I set goals and when I reached them I set even higher ones. As a result, I was the number one sales person in the company for three straight years until I was promoted to a leadership position in the marketing department.

In all areas of my life, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skill set, and because of this I enjoy taking on new situations and challenges. For example, while pursuing my master’s degree I was required to actively participate in debates on topics that I had little to no background knowledge of. Rather than stay silent throughout my courses, I took it upon myself to do extra background reading and become better versed in the information being covered in class. In very little time I was actively engaged in class discussion, and took much more away from these debates than if I had simply sat and listened.
