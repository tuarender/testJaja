<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
When it comes to business, I try to stick with the principals that work. I don’t like changing something that already works because I think it is dangerous. In my last big investment project, my coworkers and I were asked to come up with projections for the coming year. While many of the others made very loose and optimistic predictions, I used basic principals to ensure accuracy. When the returns came back the following year and results were compared, my predications, though not inventive, were the most accurate.  Because of my conservative nature, my company will enjoy another good year in the market.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As the president of a small professional auditing company, I am conservative when it comes to making changes in the way I run my business. For example, when a new form of financial software comes on the market, I do not automatically adopt it like some of my competitors. First, I wait to see how it is received, or if there are any major flaws in the programming. My staff and I are comfortable with the equipment we currently use, and I would not want to disrupt the work flow to introduce new software unless it is absolutely necessary to keep up with the rest of our industry. I will accept change when I see the need for it, but I do not necessarily believe new innovations are always better than our old, established ways of life.
