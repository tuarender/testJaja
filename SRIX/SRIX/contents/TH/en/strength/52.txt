<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
My work, both customer services and general administration, depends mostly on my ability to negotiate. This ability helps me solve problems and reach the goals that I have set. For instance, my staff had a problem with an important client who requested to have resumes of candidates in the form of attached files, not SuperResume. When we insisted they use the SuperResume, as it was our policy, they canceled the order. Therefore, I was asked to negotiate with the decision-making executives of the client company to explain the advantages of using SuperResume and give examples of failures using other system. Eventually the client reviewed the decision and later accepted the use of our system. Whenever such problems arise, my boss always assigns me to settle them.

As a sales person, negotiation is an important part of my client relationships. Most people I deal with seek to negotiate prices with me, but I must be careful when entering into such agreements. While some prices are negotiable, I must be aware of the profitable limit for my company. Maintaining this balance is essential for successful negotiations.
