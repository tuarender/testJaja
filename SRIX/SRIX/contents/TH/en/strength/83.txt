<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I believe that one must not only do his job right but also do it ethically. In a recent project, I had to create a plan for the entrance of a new medical product into the market. In doing so we needed to consider the effect that the product would have of its users and determine whether or not it was truly safe to use. Safety is one of the most important parts of my job.  Because I want to ensure that the people who use our products will be safe, I consider all ethical questions associated with my job.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
For the past five years I have worked as an auditor at a major accounting firm, reviewing and approving our clients' budgets and accounting practices. Throughout my work, I must always keep in mind important ethical principles and abide by them. I recognize that I do not just work with numbers, that there are people behind the budgets, employees and stockholders who trust those in charge to run their businesses honestly and efficiently. If and when I notice discrepancies in our clients' accounts, I make sure to not only point them out to my superior, but also follow through until I receive an explanation for the error and ensure that it is fixed.
