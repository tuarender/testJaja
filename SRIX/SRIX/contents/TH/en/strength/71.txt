I believe that my behavior influences other people. I also believe that people will rise to your expectations if you expect great things from them. During a new sales training period we had a rookie salesperson come onto the scene. He was a little nervous because he believed that he was not as good a salesman as the veterans. I sat him down and told him that I expected him to rise above us all because I saw lots of potential in him. Though it took him a while to gather his confidence, by the end of the year, he was the salesman rookie of the year.

As the head of my department, I recognize that one of my responsibilities is maintaining a high level of motivation in my staff. Keeping my employees motivated keeps their productivity high and increases their interest in and loyalty to our company. Therefore, I have established monthly sales competitions, where the highest seller in the department may receive a small gift certificate to a local restaurant or a free round of golf. I have also organized multiple staff outings, in an attempt to raise motivation at work by strengthening my employees’ relationships with myself and each other outside of the office.
