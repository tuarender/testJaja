<u><b>Example1</b></u>

Sometimes a problem doesn’t present itself until it is too late. Luckily though, I have a good eye for seeing potential problems. In our production area I was conducting an inspection when I identified a missing element in the system that presented a safety issue. I wrote a report and the need was filled immediately. Because of this I was able to prevent a potentially dangerous safety hazard, which improved the overall safety of the production area.

In my position in the information technology department at my company, I am responsible for solving problems with our computer equipment. Sometimes these problems are simple and obvious, other times they are more complex and require more time and analysis. For example, an employee in another department was having a problem connecting to the internet from his computer, and his initial description of the problem suggested there was something wrong with the internet software. However, after failing to fix the problem with our standard solutions, I discovered there an actually a problem with the computer’s hardware. After that realization, the computer was easily fixed. My many years of experience working in this field, combined with my determination to solve all of the problems with which I am presented, make me able to identify these more complex issues and address them.
