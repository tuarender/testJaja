One of the more difficult things about running a successful project is making the right decisions at the right time. That’s why I think it is important for a project manager to be decisive and not waver. Just last month I had to make a very difficult decision regarding a situation with one of my employees. After contemplating the issue for some time, I terminated him and stuck with my decision.  The man was a true asset to the team but, without this firm action, the situation may never have been handled.

One of the qualities that have made me a successful business owner is my ability to make decisions. Although I try to gather as much information as possible before making a business decision, I recognize that it will be impossible to find out everything about a situation. Rather than getting bogged down in indecision, however, I take a risk and make a move.
