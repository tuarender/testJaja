In my line of work, it is absolutely paramount that one keeps up with the latest technology. I make it a point to attend exposition shows and seminars to keep myself abreast. This has paid off over time. Last quarter, my company received a huge program development contract that required complex user-interface technology. As a part of the team, I was able to impart some the knowledge I had learned about the forthcoming regulation changes and technology. As a result, we were able to develop software that used the latest technology, complied with the changing regulations and gave our company a comparative advantage in the market.

Throughout the many positions I’ve had in my business career, I’ve always found that it is helpful for me to stay up to date on current world events. By staying aware of the latest news, I’ve been able to predict important market trends or shifts. It has also helped me in my relationships with clients; being able to chat casually with customers is always a good way of strengthening my relationship with them and building trust between us. With these benefits in mind, then, I always make sure to read a newspaper every day, and also to keep track of breaking news by listening to the radio or watching local news broadcasts.
