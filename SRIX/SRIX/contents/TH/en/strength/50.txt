I think the best thing a person could have to arm himself with is information. This is why I make sure to be knowledgeable about my industry. This has proved valuable time and time again that information is key to success. In my last consulting project, I was required to examine massive amounts of information in order to help the customer make a well-informed decision. My extensive research and experience in the market allowed me to make a solid suggestion on what the customer should do to increase performance.  When the costumer used my advice, her profits more than doubled.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
I have worked as a consultant for various firms and in various fields for the past 20 years. While my area of expertise in all of my positions has been business-related, I have also learned about a wide variety of topics during this time. For example, I have worked with clients in many different areas of the government, in different economic industries, and also in non-profit organizations working with certain social interests. It is impossible to work with clients without learning something about their areas of expertise, and therefore I have come away with a broad range of knowledge on many topics. This helps me to attract and sustain new client relationships because they know I am already familiar with their area of interest or industry and am willing to learn more about them to help them the best that I can.
