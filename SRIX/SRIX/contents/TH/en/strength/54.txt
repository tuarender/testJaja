<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am of the opinion that every role in any environment is very important. Even if I play a role that isn’t the most noticeable, I know that what I am doing will help the greater good of the company. During our last big project, I assigned the job of data entry because our regular administrative assistant was out with a severe sickness. While I usually do only analysis work, I knew that this deal was very important and so I did not complain.  My boss later commended me for my good attitude.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As a sales agent, often times I will work very closely with my clients in an attempt to gain their trust. In this process, it is occasionally inevitably the case that personal relationships are formed between me and my long-term clients. Over the years, we learn about each others’ families, personal histories, etc. When these relationships form, it is occasionally possible to forget that we are mainly business partners. However, I always keep my company first in my mind. Although I may be friends with some clients, I know that that relationship does not supercede my responsibility to earn profits for my company.
