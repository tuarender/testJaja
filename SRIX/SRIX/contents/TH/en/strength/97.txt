For me, everything has to be perfect. Because of this I sometimes don’t know when to stop fixing something or making it better and often spend long hours constantly improving myself and my surroundings. Last month I had a huge design project and I spent a total of one-hundred hours perfecting my work. I made sure that my numbers were accurate. I also spent many hours testing the product before it was released to the public. It is because of my perfectionist nature that I am able to succeed in the workplace.  My dedication to perfection ensures that I am the best at what I do.

In my office, I am well-known for the almost obsessive attention to detail I give to most of my projects, particularly those that include a presentation in front of clients. When I know that a superior or a client will be reviewing my work, I am not satisfied until I know that every aspect of the final product is perfect. This includes not only the actual content of a report, but also the specific syntax of the text, or the design of the presentation slides or report cover. Although some may argue these are inconsequential details, I do not want a typo or sloppily compiled presentation to distract from the actual content of the report or presentation. I believe that if the project I spend most of my time working on is important, then the presentation of that project is equally as important.
