<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am eager to work and make the best use of time.  If I have no new assignments to complete, I will update information, take care of the filing or complete other projects that are unfinished. Seeing that I am always working, my supervisor appreciates my work performance and gives me new assignments.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
I am eager worker and always try to remain productive at my company, where I work as a market research analyst. For example, during the brief periods when I am between projects, rather than simply taking time off I always try to find extra work I can do at the office. This may involve updating contact information in client databases or assisting one of my coworkers with one of their projects. Assisting in these little ways helps to keep the office running efficiently, and it is a productive use of my time. In addition, when I am engaged in a project, many times my instructions are vague and I am left to develop the details of the project on my own. My interest in doing the best work I can for my company motivates me to take the initiative in designing the project and to provide all the information I can to meet our clients’ needs.
