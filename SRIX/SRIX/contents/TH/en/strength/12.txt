People often compliment me for my looks. This has fortunately propelled my career into great success for me. I was working in a restaurant when my boss first found me. He told me that I was beautiful and that I would look splendid in front of a camera. After successfully shooting commercials for the company, I was hired for a full-time position.  Since then, I have used my looks and charm to land big business deals and establish key relationships for my company.

Although it is not commonly openly acknowledged, a person’s appearance is always important in any professional setting. Therefore, I make sure to pay attention to my appearance every day. I take extra time to coordinate my clothes and to make sure my hair and face look well-groomed. Whenever I go into the office, I want to look professional. Not only does it make me feel more confident in myself, it also increases other people’s confidence in me. Showing my colleagues and my clients that I care about my appearance, that I will go to extra efforts to ensure that their first impression of me is a good one, shows that I also care about my job and will go to extra efforts to ensure that I do it well.
