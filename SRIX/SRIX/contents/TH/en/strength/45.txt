I am very open about my feelings. When I feel that something is wrong I will let it be known. This has helped me in the workplace because it opens levels of communication at every stage of the operation. One time, during a major group project, I got the feeling that a member of the group was compromising the integrity of the project and I told my supervisor about it. After some delineation, we confronted the worker about the situation. He explained himself and we later found out that it was just a misunderstanding. Because of my frank and open nature, I was able to resolve a dire situation for an important part of my company’s production.

Although I am always respectful to my colleagues and superiors in the workplace, I also always try to be frank and open with my opinions and ideas. If I do not think a colleague’s project has been done correctly, or I have an idea on how to improve something in the office, I will usually let these opinions be known to those around me. I recognize that sometimes people are not very accepting of criticism, however, so I do try to express my opinions as diplomatically as possible, and also try to accept criticism of my own work graciously as well. I will not hide my opinions, however, because I know that maintaining open communication within our staff is the best way to sustain the high quality of work coming out of our department.
