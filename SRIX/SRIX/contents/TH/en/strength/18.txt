I try my hardest to keep a positive attitude no matter what the consequence. I believe that mistakes are portals of discovery and are therefore room for improvement. This is why I believe that a positive attitude is the key to success. Last summer, during a huge sales push I didn’t make my first sales goal. Even though I felt bad, I kept my eye on the prize. I kept a positive attitude and told myself that I would be number one in sales for the company. Over the next few days, I worked hard, finding leads, calling prospects and staying late at the office researching. By the end of the sales push, I was leading salesperson in the company.

I always try to be optimistic in the face of problems. In my experience, staying calm and positive helps me to think clearly and find solutions faster than I would if I were to panic. For example, last year my colleagues and I were working on a large publication project for one of my company’s largest clients. When we were nearing the deadline, our building’s computer system crashed and erased a large portion of our work. Some of my team members wanted to request an extended deadline from out client, but I remained positive that we could finish the project on time if we put in extra work. By staying calm I was able to find a way to replicate our lost work quickly and we finished out project successfully.
