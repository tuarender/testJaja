<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
Costumer service ensures business.  I serve customers to meet their utmost satisfaction. For example, I have to serve and contact customers who have different personalities and demands.  I treat them with respect and kindness and, in return, the customers often tell me that I give good service and am polite. This marks the start of a strong relationship with these customers. Being service-minded helps me meet the customers' satisfaction and build good relationships with the customers, which in time bring more business to the company.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
In my job I often have to serve and contact a large number of customers, most of whom have widely different personalities and demands. Dealing with each customer can occasionally be difficult, but I always remind myself that I am that customer’s main link to my company and that it is my responsibility to see that their needs are met. By staying service-minded, I am able to maintain good relationships with most of my customers, as well as a high sales record for my company.
