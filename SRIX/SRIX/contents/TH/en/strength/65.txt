In approaching any issue, it is paramount for a person to understand all elements involved, from the history and associated contexts to the circumstances on which the implications of a specific action stand. I believe that this information is crucial to the full understanding of an issue and assessment of further actions to be taken. In a project development task, I did research on a particular aspect of our proposal and found out that our plan had once been done, yielding terrible performance. After raising this point with the committee the decision was made to change the plan to something more efficient. As a result, the customer was satisfied and we received excellent ratings.

Throughout my career I have always been able to adapt to new situations or learn new skills quickly and easily. For example, when I began my most recent position as an assistant to the public relations officer at my company, there were many aspects of the job that I was unfamiliar. I was expected to learn new, complicated software programs and the PR officer’s preferred filing systems as quickly as possible in order to do my job effectively. Recognizing that it was important for me to transition into my position as smoothly as possibly, I dedicated myself to my new training and was able to understand my new responsibilities within two weeks.
