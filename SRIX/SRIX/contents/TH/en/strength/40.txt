I feel that working together is the best formula for success.  This phenomenon is most apparent in our public relations events.  Sometimes the public relations department cannot handle the major events alone and require our help.  With the collective force of the entire agency, we are able to turn out successful campaigns that bring in lots of publicity.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
At the advertising firm where I have worked for the past five year, we are often assigned projects in teams of three or more employees. In order to complete our assigned tasks successfully, I have found that cooperation is essential. When I first came to the company and was involved in my first team projects, I had a tendency to try to do too much and control the final outcome of the project. Over the years, however, I have learned that the best way to complete a team project is to divide responsibilities among the team members, and to also be willing to hear and accept other people’s ideas. I can accept it when my idea for a project is not chosen by my team, and have learned to only try to assist a team member when my help is requested. By loosening my control on a project and cooperating with my colleagues, my contribution to the project is of a higher quality and is more valuable than it would be otherwise.
