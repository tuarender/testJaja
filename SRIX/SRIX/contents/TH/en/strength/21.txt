<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
Apart from my closest friends, I know a lot of people of different ages and in different work fields.  I, therefore, can ask for help or advice from them to complete my work successfully. For example, I was assigned to be the president of the company's golf club, so I had to find a place for playing golf at a reasonable price. Thanks to my connections, I found the best place at the best price. Having strong connections makes my work more successful and my boss assign me challenging work.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As a sales representative, networking is an important component in fulfilling my responsibility to attract new clients for my company. Therefore, I’m always eager to meet new people, both in my personal life and professionally, and keep track of my acquaintances in case I may need to contact them in the future. Many people are shy when it comes to introducing themselves to strangers and initiating new connections, but I have always had the confidence necessary to “work a room.” I recognize the potential value in every new acquaintance, and therefore make it a priority to connect with new people as often as possible.
