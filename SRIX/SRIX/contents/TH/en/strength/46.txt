<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
Sometimes I know other better than they know themselves.  For this reason, I am usually not afraid to talk to people that I do not know.  As a salesperson this skill is very important.  It allows me to understand exactly the client’s needs even if he does not explicitly mention them.  So when I work on a task, I understand how I should completely match them to the client. With good interpersonal skills, I can always work smoothly on a task.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Throughout my 15 years working in various office settings, I have never had a serious problem with any of my colleagues or superiors. I always try to be friendly and respectful to everyone I work with, and when a misunderstanding does arise I make sure to correct it before it seriously effects either myself or a colleague. I am usually a well-liked member of every department I’ve worked for, and many bosses have complimented me on my diplomacy and communication skills.
