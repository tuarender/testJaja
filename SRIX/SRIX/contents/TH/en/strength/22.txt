When there is a problem, everyone in the office likes to come to me. Some problems are an easy fix and others require a bit more creativity. One time, there was a huge spill in the production room five minutes before the inspection agency was scheduled to come and grade our facilities on efficiency and cleanliness. I quickly lined all of the production team together in front of the spill. I had two people from the team grab the spill clean-up kit and clean it properly, taking their time to make sure that the mess was thoroughly cleaned. When I later walked by the mess with the inspection team, I calmly explained to them that we take every opportunity to make sure that a mistake is a learning experience and for this reason, everyone in the production room takes part during spill by cleaning watching the cleaning process. When we got our inspection scores back, we received the highest possible score.

As the information technology officer at my company, it is important for me to be knowledgeable in many areas of technology repair. For any hardware or software problem, I must be able to go through a list of possible solutions until I find the right one, and then implement it quickly. My resourcefulness allows the company to stay running smoothly and efficiently.
