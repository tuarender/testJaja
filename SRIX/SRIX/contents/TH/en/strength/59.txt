In consulting, mathematics is one of the key aspects of making a well thought-out analysis of the client’s needs. My ability to work complex mathematical equations quickly and efficiently has given me an edge above my coworkers. During our last big project, we had to compile large amounts of numerical data into a database as part of our analysis. During the early stages, I was able to identify a trend in the data and create a mathematical formula to model it. This cut our workload in half and gave more time for assessment in the long run. The customer was extremely satisfied with our results and came to us just last week for another job. Due to my impressive mathematical skill, we were able to increase efficiency in our work and devote more time to improving product quality.

Throughout college and my business career, I have always been skilled in mathematics. Although my main interest in school was marketing, I earned a minor in mathematics and did receive some advanced training in the field. In my career, my understanding of mathematics has helped me when working with budgets or other number- or financial-related issues. For example, my superior often looks to me to assist him with drafting our department’s budget every year. Although such work doesn’t require very advanced math, I can do the work quickly and accurately, whereas my other coworkers who are less trained in mathematics may struggle.
