<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I care about other people's feelings. When someone is going through a hard time at work, I listen to their complaints and try to make them feels better.  I know that this increases the total mood of the office and makes it a more pleasant place.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As the owner of my own small business, I recognize my responsibilities to my employees. Although many of my decisions have to revolve around the financial success of my business, in my heart I try to also take into consideration the personal interests of my staff. Therefore, I reward them when they do high quality work, and am understanding if they need to take time off for personal reasons. I try to get to know each of my employees on a personal level and let them know that I do value the work they do for my company. By doing so I believe I have created a loyal and hard-working staff.
