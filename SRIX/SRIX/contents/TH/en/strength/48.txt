<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I hate feeling that I must depend on another person. This is why I try my hardest to work independently, when I can manage it. This has impressed many of my supervisors. During a very hectic moment I was given a project to work upon alone. I was given this task because I work best alone and the project was a crucial component the companies success. I took the assignment and went away for a week. I only asked questions when I felt it necessary and I completed the assignment promptly and early. Though I did encounter some problems along the way, my independent nature allowed me to surpass them with relative ease.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As an assistant government affairs coordinator for the nonprofit organization I work for, the majority of my responsibilities are set out for me by the head of my department. However, when it is necessary I am capable of working independently and making decisions on my own. For example, due to health complications the head of my department was forced to go on a leave of absence last year just before a large media event involving not only our organization but also important representatives from the federal government. Most of the details had yet to be worked out for the event, and all of those decisions were left for me to make with little input from my superior. In the end, the event was an overall success. Since that time, my superior has begun giving me more freedom to take on my own projects and set my own goals in my job.
