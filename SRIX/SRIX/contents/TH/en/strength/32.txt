<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am able to set priorities. Each day, I list out all of my tasks and then perform the most important ones first. My boss once needed an urgent document from me; I knew that this is a priority over my routine assignments. So, I stopped what I was doing, tackled the new assignment and returned to my regularly scheduled projects upon its completion. Establishing priorities helps all the departments work faster and helps the company as a whole meet its goals.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As the information technology support specialist at my company, I am always faced with a long list of small projects and repairs that need my attention. In order to keep the company running efficiently, I must be able to prioritize these projects, addressing the most vital problems first and leaving secondary issues for later. Sometimes this involves dropping everything in order to deal with an emergency, such as a problem with our internet server, and sometimes it involves simple common sense, such as opting to patch holes in our security firewall before updating our graphic design software. In the end, all my projects are completed, but because of my prioritization skills large problems are avoided and the system is able to run as smoothly as possible.
