<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I think punctuality is very important. For example, if I have an appointment with a customer tomorrow, I will know how to get to the meeting place and when to be there.  I believe that good time management makes me successful in managing my work. It provides me time to prepare, so I will not damage others in the workplace.

<br>
As a consultant, I recognize that punctuality will help me present a positive image to my clients. Therefore, I always make it a priority to be on time to all client meetings. I plan out how I will get to the meeting and sure I leave enough time for travel. By always being punctual, I show my clients that I respect their needs and our business together.
