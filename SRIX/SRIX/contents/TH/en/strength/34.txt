<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
In my experiences, I have learned that success comes with taking risks. Five years ago, I started a company in a field where I had no experiential knowledge. I knew the road would be tough and that I would make many mistakes along the way. But I believed in myself and while I knew that the risk I took was great, the reward I would reap would be much greater. Focusing on the end result made me work hard and exercise diligence. I learned about my industry and become a leading force. While I made several mistakes and suffered greatly because of them, the lessons I learned helped me to achieve much greater things.

I have always had an adventurous spirit, and often in my career I have taken risks that my colleagues have discouraged, but have in the end proved profitable. For example, five years ago I decided to start my own consulting firm. I had worked for eight years at a large company, but felt that I would be more successful and more satisfied if I set off on this new course. I knew that my decision would mean more work and greater responsibilities, but I was confident that I would be able to handle all the challenges that come with owning a business. Thus far, I have achieved the success I hoped for, and now earn more and am happier with my career than I had been before starting off on my own.
