<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I love to do challenging work that requires me to think hard and brainstorm new ideas. For example, I refused to take a high-paying job offered by a famous company because it was not challenging enough for me. Instead, I took the job that gave me chance to learn and suggest ideas. This quality makes me learn new things and, as a result, I develop character everyday.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
When I graduated from college, I had the opportunity to take a low-level position at a well-known company in my field. However, I knew that this position would not challenge me, and so I instead opted to work for a much smaller firm where I was given the chance to learn new things and interact more with my superiors. Because of my desire to take challenges, I have been able to better develop my knowledge and skills.
