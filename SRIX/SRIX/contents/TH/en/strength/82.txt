<u><b>Example1</b></u>

There is something about working under pressure that helps me perform much better and motivates me to achieve higher goals. I believe that my desire to impress people increases the adrenaline rush I get when I know that there is a lot of weight riding on my performance. Last year I was given a project to present the analysis reports to our biggest client. My boss told me later that the project would make or break to company. Because of this I knew that I had to succeed or the company would fail. This knowledge motivated me to work hard and make sure that everything would be perfect.

As a financial advisor, I am constantly under pressure to perform well for both my company and my clients. My duties require me to not only remain well-informed of the latest events in financial markets worldwide, but also to be able to accurately predict what will be happening in those markets in the near future. Although this requires many hours of work at all times of the day, I enjoy the challenges it presents. Working in the constantly changing environment of a financial market is thrilling and satisfying, particularly when I am able to bring in profits for my company and clients.
