<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
Everyone comes to me for advice. This is because I am good at utilizing information in order to make sound decisions. During our last prototype development I was given the task of researching the material and process before creation. Whenever there was a question of what we should do, my coworker came to me for advice because I had the prototype development experience and knowledge.  Having an experienced and knowledgeable consultant on hand saved my company time and money.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
After 10 years as a financial consultant for local governments, I believe that I have developed a certain level of expertise in this area. I have learned how to talk to different levels of government officials and how to be persuasive and diplomatic with my clients. I have also acquired a long list of contacts, which helps me connect clients to people who may help them, or to meet new potential clients through mutual connections. During my career I have helped numerous governments re-balance their budgets, or earn millions of dollars through government grants they would not have known about without my assistance. I am more than satisfied with the work I have done so far, and look forward to a long career of similar success.
