Most people think that my ideas are somewhat eccentric, but I think they are visionary. The reason for this belief is that I know that being a visionary is to be able to think differently from the people around you.  Not only that but it is also having faith in what you see and helping others to see it as well. This year, our company needed a new marketing strategy to help expand sales into a new market. When I presented my plan to the committee, everyone believed that the plan would not work and that the odds of success were slim to none. So, I explained it to them further and went into more detail, explaining the research that I conducted and showing my reasoning every step of the way. After a while, they all agreed. By the end of the quarter, the plan was implemented and sales doubled.

As a market analyst, one of my responsibilities is to be able to predict future trends in the world stock market. Although these predictions can partially be made by looking at current conditions, a good analyst also trusts his intuition and takes risks. I have been able to do both these things during my career, and have seen many of my predictions become reality.
