When I do something, I make sure that I do it right. I believe that this is what keeps the customers coming back. Because of this, I go above and beyond to keep the customer not only satisfied but also delighted. For example, there was a customer who was having quality issues with her product. She came to me for help. She needed the item to be repaired immediately because it directly affected her business. I found the engineer who designed it, told him about the issue and offered to help him with anything he needed to get the repairs done as soon as possible. At the same time, I let the customer know that the repairs would be free and supplemented that with complementary accessories. She was so delighted with my service that she came back to us next year to order twice as much product as her last order.

At the architecture firm I have worked at for the past five years, we always begin each new project by asking the client what they would like to build if money were no object. After they describe their dream project to us, it is then my responsibility to take that vision and try to design a building as close to it as possible within the confines of the budget and zoning codes we have to deal with. My goal is to create the most perfect final product possible, and while many times this requires much creative thinking and effort, I am always able to find a way to fulfill most of my client’s wishes.
