<u><b>Example1</b></u>

I’m sensitive to people’s feelings and behavior. That is why when there is a dispute in the office, I am able to find common ground. For example, there was a time when two coworkers with lots of experience were fighting over who would have the most control over the project. After some time of fighting, I stepped in and helped them identify who was better at controlling different tasks and divided power accordingly. Because of this ability to be diplomatic among people with conflicting interests, I was able to maintain a peaceful environment at the office.

In my work as a business consultant, diplomacy is a key skill. When working with clients to fix problems in their companies, it is important to address those problems delicately and diplomatically. Rather than bluntly critiquing their business practices and simply laying down recommendations, I take the time to learn the history of the company, how certain problems have evolved over time, and then brainstorm with the client in coming up with solutions that are unique to his situation. By doing this I know my clients are more likely to take my advice. Diplomacy involves showing a concern for your clients and a willingness to adjust your opinions and interests to better accommodate theirs. Without it, I would not be able to do my job.
