<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
At work I am a very forceful person.  I build strong and efficient systems that help my team reach goals. For example, I promised to report the plant's financial budget to the Managing Director on the 10th of each month. To keep my word, I had the accounting staff record all the payments and expenses by 5 p.m. each day so that I could check the balances daily.  This would allow me to compile the data properly before handing it to the manager. Being forceful and self-disciplined helps me reach company goals and become trustworthy.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As the head of the accounting department of a large industrial plant, I have a reputation for being a strict yet efficient boss. For example, I have set precise deadlines for my staff, which I expect them to meet regularly. One deadline involves a report on the plant’s financial budget, which I have promised my superiors I would make available to them on the tenth day of each month. To accomplish this, I require my staff to record payments and expenses every day by 4 p.m. so that I have time to review and correct them. When this work is finished each day, compiling the final information into a monthly report is a simple process; when it is not, our work becomes much harder and less efficient. Therefore, my staff’s ability to meet deadlines is a vital component of our work. Requiring them to work under such deadlines may make me a forceful, and perhaps unpopular, boss, but our department is known in the company for its efficient and precise work.
