I love people. I’ve been able to use my friendly nature positively on the job. As a salesperson, I feel it important to be personable and friendly with the customer. Last year, we had a huge prospect that wanted to make one of the biggest orders in our company history. I took the customer out and we became good friends. I learned about her family and hobbies. Unfortunately, she didn’t place the order because she found something she already owned the fill the need. But she told her business partners about us and they placed an even larger order than the client I had befriended. By the way, I attended her wedding last summer.

I have always been an extroverted person. I love to meet new people, make new friends and attend social gatherings. As a sales associate, I find that these tendencies are very helpful in the workplace. My eagerness to meet new people helps expand my networking circles, and helps me to talk to my clients comfortably and gain their trust.
