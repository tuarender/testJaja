How you treat someone in the workplace is the most important aspect of work. I believe that if you do not treat others with respect, they will not reciprocate the treatment. As a result, I make sure to treat everyone at work as I would like to be treated. Following this philosophy will make work an overall better place to be.  We recently got a new supervisor.  I made sure to treat her with great respect and help her with all of her needs.  In turn, when I came to her with a problem she treated me the same way.

As I have risen in the ranks of my company, where I have worked for the past 17 years, I have noted the socioeconomic divides within the large amount of people who work around me. From the janitorial staff to the secretaries to my colleagues on the management level, there are always common, if false, stereotypes about the people in these positions. And while I have seen some of my fellow managers show disdain for people at lower levels in the company, I have always made a point of showing them respect. I talk to the people I see in the halls every day and try to get to know them on a personal level. I recognize the value of every one of my employees, and try to let them know that. By doing so, I help to create a comfortable, positive working environment.
