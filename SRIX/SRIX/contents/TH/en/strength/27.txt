<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am an organized person.  Everything I do at work goes in a systematic fashion.  This way, I can provide my boss with any documents he needs very fast. My style of work is very convenient for myself and other people. Working systematically helps me push my projects to success quickly and as a salesman I understand that being organized is needed in sales and in planning.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As the managing editor of a weekly trade magazine, my many responsibilities at work require me to be extremely organized. I have a staff of 25 writers who are all constantly on assignment. Not only do I assign them their stories, I also follow up with them to ensure that there are no problems with their articles. I am also responsible for reviewing and approving the page layouts for each issue. Hanging over all of these responsibilities is the magazine’s weekly deadline. I have found that organization is essential in completing all my tasks to meet that deadline. This means not only managing my time well – every morning I create a schedule for the day, and stick to it – but also the enormous amount of information I or my staff may need for any given issue. For example, I have compiled long lists of potential sources and their contact information, and have also seen to it that the most current publications in our trade have been collected in our office’s own mini-library. Sticking to my schedule and having all the information I need to do my job organized and at-hand allows me to run this publication efficiently and on time.
