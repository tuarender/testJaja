I believe that a good worker is a happy worker. This is why I try to lighten up mood by cracking jokes around the office. I’ve heard that the best medicine for any sickness is laughter. This has proven most useful when the team has low spirits. One time, the team lost a big deal to a rival company and everyone was discouraged. Because of my good sense of humor I was able to lift everyone’s spirits by telling stories and jokes about various people I had encountered in my life.  The team’s morale increased and we were ready to work the next day.  My sense of humor lifted the spirits of my colleagues.

Throughout my years at school I was always known for my sense of humor. Although I never expected to use my humor in the business world, I have found that it occasionally is very useful. For example, in otherwise tense business negotiations, I have found that the well-paced light joke will help to ease the tensions and smooth communications. Bringing humor into the workplace can help to increase happiness and productivity in the office, and I am glad to be able to make that possible for my colleagues.
