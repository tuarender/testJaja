I consider myself to be a creative person. When brainstorming for new ideas, I usually just let my creativity take control. This helps me to think innovatively and out of the box. During the summer we needed to come up with a marketing campaign to attract a new audience. I came up with a brilliant idea that came to me in the shower that utilized interactivity between the customer and the product. As a result the new campaign increased sales by thirty-five percent.

For the past two years I have worked at an advertising company that specializes in web-based ad campaigns. Working in this industry inherently requires some level of creativity, such as when our team brainstorms slogans or graphic design for an advertisement. When an ad campaign is based entirely on the Internet, however, I have found that it requires an extra level of creativity from its designers. The medium is still fairly new, with innovations in web design happening all the time, and our job is to find new ways to use the Internet that will appeal to and attract our clients’ target audience. This involves investigating and weighing many different variables, most of which aren’t involved in television or print advertising. For example, we need to research specifically what types of sites we should be targeting with our advertisements, as well as different ways we can integrate advertisements into web sites so they are noticeable but unobtrusive. I have enjoyed the opportunity to combine the creativity of designing a new ad campaign with that of exploring different ways to use technology, and I think I’ve been successful at it: after a year, I was promoted to the head of the team in charge of one of my company’s biggest accounts.
