<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am honest because honesty makes me work happily. When there is nothing to hide everything just seems to go smoother.  There was a project that I had to do from home due to its high sensitivity.  I kept an open line of communication with my boss to let him know my progress.  When I finished he was so pleased that he let me do the rest of my projects from home.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
There is a common perception of salespeople as deceptive, dishonest individuals whose only goal is to earn their commissions. In my five years as a sales associate, however, I have learned that it is always best to be honest with clients about the products you are selling. I will answer their questions openly and alert them to any problems I know of with the products they are considering. My goal is not simply to sell them something, but to sell them a product that will meet their needs. If I lie about any aspect of my sale, they will remember that and will not do business with myself or my company every again. Honesty builds trust, and that is the most important part of my relationships with my clients.
