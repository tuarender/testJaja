<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I place much importance on treating people fairly. I believe that if you do not treat people fair they will treat you unfairly. Because of this, in the workplace, I make sure to treat people with the kindness and respect that they deserve. During our last major project, I established the rules of engagement and made it clear that no one would get special treatment. Unfortunately, one person on the team thought that he would get special treatment because he was a part of the family. After he violated one of the rules, I decided to let him go. This was helpful because it made him an example of my fair treatment. From then on, everyone did their work quickly and responsibly with no major problems and equal contribution to the team.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As a supervisor of a ten-person staff, I always make it a priority to treat my employees fairly. For example, I distribute responsibilities evenly throughout the staff and pay attention to ensure that all employees are fulfilling their duties. When there is a problem, I speak with all the employees involved to understand every side of the conflict and come to the best, most fair solution possible. Conversely, when my staff succeeds in an especially important project, I make sure to acknowledge their accomplishments and reward them in some way, such as giving them extra time off. Being an attentive, fair-minded supervisor helps to create a positive atmosphere in my department, and we all work more productively because of it.
