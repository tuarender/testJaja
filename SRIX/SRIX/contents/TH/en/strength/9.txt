I make friends easily.  In the mornings I make sure to greet everyone in the office.  During breaks, I also mingle with workers and try to make the people around me smile. Being friendly contributes to the unity of the work environment increases the cooperation among my colleagues.  I feel that it’s important to be friendly because as a salesperson, making the customer feel welcome is paramount.

As a salesperson, having a friendly demeanor is essential when working with clients. For me, this goes beyond simply greeting clients and explaining my company’s products to them. I also try to connect with my clients on a more personal level – asking after their families, personal interests and hobbies, etc. This helps to create trust in our relationship, which is essential if I am going to convince them to purchase products. My friendliness improves my relationships with my existing clients, helps me bring in new clients, and increases the profits that I earn my company.
