<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am patient. I can face difficulty adversity in its worst form. For example, when my peers looked down upon me the first day on the job, I was patient and later earned their respect. My success depends on my patience because I know things will eventually get better.  For this reason I am able to control myself in very tense moments. When I can wait, listen to other people's rude comments and stay focused in a tough situation, I can control things in my work environment.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
When faced with a difficult situation, I am able to patiently wait it out and calmly find a solution to my problems. For example, I recently came into conflict with one of my coworkers in my office. In response to my voicing a difference in opinion over how our department should approach a new client project, he rudely attacked me in front of the rest of my colleagues. This was not the first time he had treated me with disrespect, but each time I have managed to maintain my composure and respond maturely to his ill treatment, maintaining my position but also making sure to treat him with the respect I wish he would show me as well. My ability to handle the situation in this way has unfortunately not improved my relationship with my coworker, but it has earned me more respect from my colleagues in the rest of my department.
