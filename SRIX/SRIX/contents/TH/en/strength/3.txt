<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
In my work, I always pay attention to detail and move methodically. The last major project I did with my company involved taking mass amounts of information and identifying key points of interest for contemplation. My natural analytical skills helped me to find several trends in the market. The discovery helped me to understand many of the issues we had faced with our customers and, in turn, allowed us to solve many of the quality issue we were having. Though sometimes I am slow, my process allows me to work logically and minimizes errors and oversights.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As a researcher for a private media corporation, analysis is an important part of my daily work. Each day I am responsible for sifting through a large amount of various news releases, and it is my responsibility to determine links between related stories and which events are the most newsworthy topics of the day. Not only does this require analyzing the content of the releases themselves, but also the interests of our clients. Where I see a connection between these two things, then I know I have a news report that I must pass along to my superiors. My ability to analyze, to recognize the important topics and discard the rest, helps my company to best serve our clients the information they need.
