<u><b>Example1</b></u>

I love to give others a hand when they need help. My close friend was carrying out a very hard job. So I willfully helped complete the job when I was free on weekends. Being helpful makes me get good support when I am in trouble. One day I had a problem with graphic designing and I didn’t think anybody could help me since I am the only graphic designer in the company. My close friend whom I helped before was the first person to come to me and offer help. Though he is not the graphic designer, he was still very helpful.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>

Although my supervisor tends to assign each employee individual projects to complete on our own, I always try to help my coworkers if and when they are having a problem with their work. This might mean helping them research hard-to-find information and putting together a project, or simply checking a report for typos before they submit the final draft. Doing these small favors for my colleagues is personally satisfying, but also carries side benefits: when I need assistance with one of my projects later on, they are likely to reciprocate the favor. Overall, the cooperative atmosphere helps us all perform more efficiently produce higher quality work.
