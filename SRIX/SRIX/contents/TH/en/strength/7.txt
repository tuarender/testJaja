<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I understand and learn information and processes very quickly.  For example, I once learned the company’s new information technology system in under four hours.  This allowed the flow of information to increase throughout the firm tremendously. Being a fast learner help me and my colleagues to complete assignments quickly.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
I am a fast learner, able to develop new skills and understand new technology quickly and efficiently. For example, I have worked in the public relations department of a company for the past five years, and we recently adopted an entirely new computer software program for tracking our relationships with our clients and external partners. Although the program was fairly complex, within a few weeks I was working comfortably in the new system and had imported my five years worth of files into the program. Because of my quick understanding of the program, I was also asked to help train my colleagues in its use.
