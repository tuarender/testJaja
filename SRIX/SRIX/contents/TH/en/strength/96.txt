If I intend to do anything, I’m going to do it no matter what. I feel unhappy leaving assignments incomplete. And even if it takes me several tries to get something done, I’ll do it until I am satisfied.  I once told myself that I would get certified in user design technology systems.  I studied for one year before taking the exam.  I took the exam three times before passing it.  Though I was discouraged the first two times, I never gave up.  Now, I’m the companies lead design technologist.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>

Five years after earning my bachelor’s degree, I realized that I would only be able to move up in my career if I returned to school for a master’s degree. I was accepted into one of the top graduate programs in my area of study, but midway through the program I was forced to take a leave of absence due to family concerns. Although returning to the program six months later was very challenging to me and required even more effort than starting the program in the first place, I did return and quickly earned my master’s. With the advanced degree, I almost immediately received a promotion at my current company. Although returning to school was difficult, my determination to do so and to finish what I had started has resulted in innumerable benefits for my and my family.
