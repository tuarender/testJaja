Loyalty is the most important element for employees. Without it, one cannot work happily. For instance, I have been working with Topgun for over three years, during which time I have dedicated myself greatly to my work and the company. I always help other employees in push our company to the top. I want to share the future of the company with other employees.  Because of this I believe that I work for a good company.  I am happy with them and plan to stay with them for a very long time.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
In the 30 years since I began my career, I have only switched companies two times. In each instance, external factors led me to transfer companies; had I been in control of the situation, I would have remained where I was. For example, the second company I worked for was forced to dissolve after the collapse of the internet-based business market. I was one of the original investors in the company, and remained in my position even as our business sustained large financial losses many quarters in a row. I choose to stay loyal to the companies I work for because I believe I owe it not only to the company that pays my salary, but to the people I work with. I expect them to come to work every day and do their best, and I recognize that I owe them the same effort on my own part.
