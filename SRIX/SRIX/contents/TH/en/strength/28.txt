I care about my coworkers. I also try to be helpful and understanding when one of them is going through a hard time. Last month, during a building development project that required long hours, one of my coworkers received terrible news about her family. While I knew that I couldn’t do much to help, I suggested that she take some time away from work in order to deal with the situation properly. She came back shortly thereafter and completed all of her assignments on time. In giving her extra time, she was able to return and make meaningful contributions to the project.

As a personal investment banker, I work with clients in establishing their investment portfolios. For each client, I recognize that they are not simply working with me to earn money; they have come to me for helping in achieving certain goals. For example, some clients may be interested in building a portfolio that will earn enough to send their children to college, while others intend to use their investments to support them after retirement. In working with them, therefore, it is important for me to be considerate of their goals, and to design an investment plan specifically geared toward helping them achieve those goals.
