Success follows good management in my opinion. Good management encompasses knowing all aspects of the business and being able to understand the role of each employee even your own. At my store, I make sure to maintain a good relationship with all my employees. This understanding allows me to know the troubles and issues that my co-workers might be going through. One week ago, a fourth of my workforce left due to a decision I made to drop pay rates, because of the competing market. I met with the remainder of the crew and told them the situation. I made a list of all the duties that needed to be done in order to maintain minimal operation levels and divided it equal, among all of us. Over the next six weeks we were able to maintain the store, increase sales, which in turn brought more money in. I increased pay rates and doubled the work force by the next year.

As the training supervisor at my company, it is my responsibility to make sure that every employee receives the proper training courses that our upper management team determines that they need. This requires me to manage literally every employee at our company, making sure they sign up for classes, attend them, and then keep their training current with additional mini-courses later on. Training courses are often not a priority for most people, and therefore most of my job involves tracking employees down and persuading them to fulfill their training requirements. Through my efforts, I have been able to keep our staff training up-to-date, meaning that not only are my superiors pleased, but our staff is also knowledgeable and better able to serve our customers.
