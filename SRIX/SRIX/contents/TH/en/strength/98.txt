One of the most important parts of maintaining a successful business is to be able to treat customers with professionalism and respect. I make sure that I look well, am courteous and pay attention to all of our customers. The last order that we received at our company came as a result of this. I presented our products at a convention and made sure that I was dressed professionally. A lady approached me and commented on my outfit. She later bought several items.  I later asked her about our service and she told me that since I was dressed so professionally and kept a well-mannered composure, she knew that our company was the right supplier for her, because those are things that she greatly respects.

As an administrative assistant, I know how important it is to always maintain a professional and well-mannered appearance to everyone I encounter, especially outside visitors to the company. I know my demeanor reflects on my company and my boss, and I want people’s impressions of me to always be positive for that reason. Therefore, I am always dressed in formal business attire, even when it may not be required of me, and I always try to be helpful and welcoming to the clients or other people that meet with my boss every day.
