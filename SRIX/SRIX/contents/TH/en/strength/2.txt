<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I have been driven by my desire to be successful. I learn from the experiences of the successful people around me. As an incoming salesperson, I watched how other older members of the team received rewards for their achievements.  I wanted to do the same. Because of this I worked to reach my goals and make my supervisor trust me.  As a result, he assigned me more work so I could be promoted and received rewards.

<br>
I have been ambitious my entire life. In college, I was always the student who read every assignment, spoke with every professor, and spent every summer at an internship. Every moment, I was working towards my ultimate goal of designing computer software. Five years ago I began my career as a computer programmer, and my ambition has continued to help me succeed at my current job. I am constantly enthusiastic about my work, and always volunteer for any extra assignments in order to gain as much experience as I can. My superiors recognize my commitment to my work, and trust me to take on more difficult projects as a result. Truly, my ambition has been the key to the success I am enjoying today.
