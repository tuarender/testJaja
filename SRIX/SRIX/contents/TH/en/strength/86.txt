<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
When I get assignments, I complete them by their deadline, even if I have to stay overnight. For example, I was responsible for doing a presentation for a customer. I needed to reschedule the presentation programs. So I kept working throughout the night to finish my work on schedule and make my presentation perfect. All my jobs and projects must be done right before I finish them, so my boss is confident of my work.

Throughout my career, I have been known as an employee who can be counted on to finish her assignments. For example, when I worked as a sales representative I was responsible for creating and conducting regular presentations for a variety of clients. Although the company had a standard presentation already established, many times revisions would have to be made to accommodate each specific client. I was also willing and able to stay beyond regular work hours to do the work that was necessary to present a polished image of our company to our clients. Because of my dedication to my work, I never missed a deadline and was frequently praised for the high quality of my presentations.
