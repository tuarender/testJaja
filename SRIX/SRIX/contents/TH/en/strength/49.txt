To be an innovator one has to be able to think outside of the box. Part of this is being resourceful. During a major production line in which we had three different machines working, two of the machines broke down. But we needed to make an urgent deadline so I took parts from on of the machines and put them into another in order to get at least two machines functional, while the parts for the third machine were on back order. Because of this innovative and out of the box thinking, the deadline was met without a problem.

I enjoy initiating what has not yet been created, and when I see a need I try my best to find a way to fill it. For example, during my later college years I worked extensively with a local village government in reorganizing and computerizing their building and zoning codes. I realized that a software program created specifically for such codes would make the entire process much easier, and I spent the next year designing such a program. Now, more than ten local governments in my area have adopted my program.
