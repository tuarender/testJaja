In design, color is one of the most important aspects of true attraction. My ability to match color and texture has given me lots of success as a marketer. One of our clients was trying to enter into a new market. They wanted an ad that would attract their target audience. I did research to find out which color was most attractive to the audience and then collated the colors in the ads and websites associated with the company. After six weeks, the company became a serious contender in their industry.  Because of my color matching ability, I was successfully attracted a target market.

Whenever my advertising team is assigned to make a presentation to a client, I am the team member who is left to design the layout our presentation slides and final report. This task is left to me because I have always had a good sense of color and design. I enjoy designing graphics and experimenting with new layouts and color schemes, and usually can find a design that fits with our client or presentation topic perfectly. My work has not only been praised by my coworkers and boss, but also by many clients as well.
