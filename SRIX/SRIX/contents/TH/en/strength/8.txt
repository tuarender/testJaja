I like to go with the flow of the market especially when running my company because I know that not every event can be planned for. So when new problems present themselves, I use them as opportunities for understanding and improvement. During my last business venture several issues came up with quality, forcing me to change my original plans.  I learned from this and watched the market very closely.  Because of this I was able to change with market conditions with relative ease.

As a freelance web designer, I have learned to be flexible when dealing with clients. Many have never been involved in web site creation, and they aren't exactly sure what they want their final product to look like when they first hire me. I work with them in deciding what information they want to include on their site, and then provide them with many different options on how the site could be designed. Clients often ask me to combine different elements of those designs - perhaps they like the color scheme of one and the layout of another, for example - and it is my responsibility to meet those requests. I’ve also had clients who have asked me design a layout one way, and in the end decided they would prefer an entirely different design. I’m open to these sudden changes, and do my best to match my clients’ visions for their sites. I do give clients my advice on which design I believe would work best for their company, but in the end it is their site, and I must adapt my work to fit their needs.
