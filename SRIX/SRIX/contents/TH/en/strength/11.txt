<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
The one thing that an organization needs is a good leader. I’m usually not afraid to take over the ranks of a group. When I was first introduced to my group, I established who was in charge within the first meeting. During this phase, I had to establish levels of respect such that everyone would acknowledge my authority. Of course, I didn’t do this with force I had to earn their respect by showing them that I had to capacity to lead them, motivate them, and give them hope for the future. Since then our working relationship has run very smoothly and without serious issues.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
For the past ten years I have run my own small accounting firm, and in that time I have had to develop as a leader for my employees. I have learned to coordinate projects within the office, delegating responsibilities among my staff members, and have also learned how to listen to my employees’ suggestions and requests and keep them happy and satisfied in the workplace. In all of my efforts I believe I have been successful. Most of my employees choose to stay with my company for many years, and the high quality work they produce has earned my company much respect among our clients.
