<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am a humble person who love to smile and pay respect to other people. For example, in a tense situation when my boss becomes upset with me, I listen to his comments calmly. After that, I talk to my senior about what I should do next to solve the problem and dissipate the anxiety. Being humble makes me beloved by other people. They come to help me and contribute to my success.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
In close working environments I have always tried not to let my ego or pride get in the way of mine or my coworkers’ productivity. In my department we work in small teams for a variety of projects, and in those types of situations it is always important to make every team member feel useful and appreciated in order to maintain peace and work efficiently. Therefore, I have always remained humble, never taking credit for more than my share of the work and always making a point of complimenting my coworkers on their contribution to the final product.
