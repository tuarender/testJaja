I think that when a person lets his emotions get in the way of making well-considered decision, he has a chance to make terrible mistakes. Last year, we had to decide to let one of our most prized employees go.  I didn’t want to let him go, because the he had done lots of work for us and I had grown quite attached to him. But his performance was lacking and he was dragging down the productivity of the company. Though it was a difficult decision, I was able to set aside my feelings and execute it.

Although it is often easy, and sometimes appropriate, to allow emotions into your work, I have found that it is also important to maintain an unemotional and rational approach to certain things. For example, as the manager of my department I was responsible for conducting lay-offs during a recent downsizing of my company. Although over the years I have of course grown emotionally attached to many of my employees, I recognized the best, most fair way to determine who would be laid off was by looking at their productivity and other impersonal factors. I knew that allowing my emotions to enter the equation would be inappropriate. In the end, although there were some hurt feelings, most of my staff was satisfied with my decision-making process.
