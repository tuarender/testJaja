<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I try to keep all of my promises. The amount of dedication and effort I put toward any project is always the same. During our last major sales project, we were to follow up on several leads. Whenever we had a sales call, were to obtain more leads from them. Some of my colleagues did not do this consistently, fearing that custumers would react badly. I, on the other hand, made sure to ask for leads every time, which, in turn, lead to consistent sales results and higher overall sales for my company.

As an administrative assistant, consistency is an important part of my job. It is important that I always show up to work on time, meet deadlines, and follow schedules as planned. By doing this, I show my boss that I am trustworthy, that he c an rely on me to complete the tasks he assigns me and to be available when he needs me. If I weren’t consistent in my work, this trust between us would not exist and neither of us would be able to complete our jobs successfully.
