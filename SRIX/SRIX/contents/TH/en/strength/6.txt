<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I pay great attention to accuracy and detail. Even with a typing job, I take my time as my work will likely be seen on a website or in brochures. I check my spelling and the grammar in each sentence, making sure that it is no less than perfect. As a result, my supervisor never has to spend his time checking and correcting my work.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
When large reports or presentations are being prepared in my office, I am always asked to edit rough drafts and check for grammar or spelling mistakes before the final publication. I have always paid attention to the small details of a project, and during my time at college I was trained in copy-editing. This training taught me to go over every line of a report, quickly identifying and fixing errors. It is important to me that the publications my company sends out are as accurate and well-written as possible. This shows that we respect our clients and helps to improve our reputation in the business world. If my skills can help my company to achieve that goal, then I am more than willing to assist in any way I can.
