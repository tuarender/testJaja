In a busy environment it’s easy for things to get out of control. At my job, I make sure that this doesn’t happen. I keep things under control and at a manageable level. Two years ago, during our busiest season, the office was a mess. Because of time constraints, people in the office kept their workspaces untidy. This became a problem as they began to misplace important documents for operation, increasing production time and, in some cases, missing deadlines. I later picked a day for everyone to come in after hours to clean and organize the office for increased efficiency and productivity. I then kept an eye on my employees, requiring them to turn in progress reports on which they reported on tidiness and organization. In four weeks, our productivity increased by over fifty percent.

For the past two years I have at the head of a six-person advertising team at my firm. As such, my responsibilities include directing new projects, delegating responsibilities within the team and making sure the project is completed successfully and on time. This requires me to be skilled at supervising and controlling my staff. Not only do I keep tabs on their performances, I also make sure they are sufficiently motivated and willing to do the work I have assigned. So far, my efforts have been successful: we have met all of our deadlines, and been given larger and more important projects for our efforts.
