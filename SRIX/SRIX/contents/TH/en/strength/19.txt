<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I believe that a true measure of performance is the end result.  When I work, that is what I keep in mind to motivate me.  As a salesperson, this is most important because it keeps me focused.  There was once a trophy prize during a major push week.  I took a picture of the trophy and kept it with me every time I went on a sales call.  After two year, I finally got the trophy.  It was a glorious moment.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
In my work as a policy consultant for various government departments, I tailor my advice to what I believe will achieve real, measurable results. Many times in politics, conflicting sides reach compromises that, while they look good on paper, result in ineffective policies. The two sides can congratulate themselves for reaching an agreement, but the conflict they were addressing has not been solved. In my work, therefore, I attempt to persuade my clients to implement effective policies. Using expert studies and recommendations, I work with them in drafting policy that will not only be acceptable to all the parties involved, but will also result in undeniable change once it is implemented.
