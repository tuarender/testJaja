I’m a very curious person. I often find myself in great adventures because of my curiosity. This quality has recently provided me with great success in a business venture. I wanted to know what would happen if I marketed an item in a truly unique way. I talked with my consultant to see if the design I came up with was viable. Soon, I tried it out. After some time, I implemented the plan and waited for the results. Though the plan did not work, I learned several things throughout my experience and will use that knowledge to my advantage in the future.

Ever since my time at college, I have always been a technology buff. I love exploring and experimenting with the newest computer innovations, and I always make it a point to attend local technology expositions every year. Although this interest in technology is not obviously related to my work as an accountant, it does allow me to stay current with the newest computer software that is applicable to the accounting field. I am always the first in my office to adopt the latest accounting software, most of which enormously improves the efficiency of my work. In this way my natural curiosity about technology, while it seems like a personal hobby, also helps to improve my work performance.
