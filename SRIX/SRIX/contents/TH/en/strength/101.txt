<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
Normally I have a lot of things to do each day, but I manage them without getting bored.  Jobs like order contract issuance, update sales kit launch, and presentation preparation come natural to me after a short while. Being a routine performer, I make each task the best rather than get bored.  I work with an intention to succeed in all my assignments, even if they might seem redundant.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Working in the accounting office of a large company, most of my days follow a regular routine. While some may find the work, monotonous, however, I never get bored of my job. I see how my work is valuable to the company, and even in the normal routine I recognize variances and new challenges that make every day different.
