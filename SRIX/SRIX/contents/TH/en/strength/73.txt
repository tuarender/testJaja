When it comes time to making a decision, the most important thing to do is figure out what is best for everyone involved. This is the principle that I use when making a decision. Last year, we had to come up with a plan to allocate materials among my coworkers. I had to gauge the skills of each employee and give each person materials according to his or her skill level.  Without this level of good judgment, each person would have received materials unmatched to his ability.

When presented with large, life-changing decisions, I believe that I have regularly employed good judgment. For example, coming out of college I was presented with the choice of pursuing a low-ranking position with a large, well known accounting firm or a slightly higher-ranking position with a much smaller, more obscure organization. Although my of my classmates chose to pursue the prestige that comes with working for a well-known firm, I decided to go with the smaller company. I reasoned that I would be able to gain more experience on a broader variety of topics that I would with the larger firm. Today I believe I made the right choice: in speaking with my former classmates, I realize that my time with my smaller company has given me much more opportunity and knowledge in our field than they have been able to receive in the larger firm.
