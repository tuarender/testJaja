<u><b>Example1</b></u>

I am a very energetic person. This has helped me in the workplace because I do not get tired easily. During our last development project, one of our suppliers was late on providing us with an analysis. As a result, I decided to work two days straight in order to make the deadline. I took breaks when needed, but ultimately worked straight through the night presented the product to the client the next day. Because of my endurance and untiring nature, I was able to complete the project in time for the product unveiling.

I am naturally an energetic person, and I prefer to stay active at work. This helped me when I first started working as a sales executive three years ago. I had no training in the field, but my enthusiasm made it easier for me to learn how to sell and negotiate quickly. Now that I am experienced in the department, I use my energy to take on extra clients and larger projects, so that I am constantly busy. My full schedule makes my job exciting and interesting and helps me remain dedicated and happy at work.
