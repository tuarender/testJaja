The only true measure of success is good and strict evaluation. As a systems quality advisor, I evaluate business in the areas of efficiency, productivity and customer satisfaction. Part of this is not only observing what is there, but also observing is not there. During my last observation session, I witnessed a system that was particularly productive, but lacked in efficiency. In my evaluation of the system, I suggested the purchase of a new calibration system, because the one they had was outdated. As a result, their efficiency increased by seventy percent and they were able to spend more time and energy on customer satifaction. Because of this comprehensive evaluation, I was able to identify a weakness in the system and suggest a means for improving it.

I am highly involved in the budget planning process at my company, which requires me to evaluate large amounts of information on a regular basis. Not only do I look at the company's overall revenue and expenditures, but also the detailed budgets in each department. I evaluate our hiring practices, need for new equipment, and other aspects of running the company in order to determine if there are any areas for improvement. Through my work, I help the company run more efficiently.
