I believe that nothing can really get done without swift action. In the past, I have learned that while plans and strategies for a specific goal may be magnificent, execution is the most important step. Last year, I was given the schematics of a market-entrance strategy that required my team and me to locate potential clients. This was a daunting task, because the company had no market share. I met with my team to put together a list of action steps. Each step had an attached due date on which it was to be completed. The meeting made sure that the project would progress smoothly and get done in a timely fashion. And while we did run into some issues along the way, we completed the entire project before the deadline. Without this form of quick execution, the project would have been grossly unorganized and very late.

While careful planning is of course an essential part of running any organization, I believe it is important to know when to evolve from the planning stage of a project and begin taking action. For example, three years ago I was promoted to the head of the marketing and communications department of my company. It had long been recognized that the department was not performing as efficiently as possible and was in need of reorganization, but the prior department head had done nothing beyond researching possible solutions to the problem. He spent more than a year planning to reorganize the department while taking no action. When I took over the department, I immediately began the process of reorganization, consulting with my superiors and a handful of my employees for their suggestions on the best solution and then putting a plan into place. Within a month, the department was running significantly more productively.
