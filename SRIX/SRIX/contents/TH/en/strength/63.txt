<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I think being trustworthy is to being able to take responsibility for what I promised to do. Due to my personality, people do trust me. For example, if I give the deadline for assignment completion, I keep my word. If I am not sure I can make the deadline, I will never promise to finish a project that way I will remain trustworthy. Being trustworthy brings me recognition when communicating with my colleagues and outsiders.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As an administrative assistant to the CEO of my company, I am often privy to the inner-workings of our business, more so than most of the other employees. I sit in on meetings with other company officials, direct correspondence with the CEO, and assist her on other miscellaneous projects. To be effective in my job, therefore, I must be trustworthy and reliable. I keep confidential information to myself, and ensure that I am always available when my boss needs my assistance. In this way, I make sure she knows that she can trust me, and that I can be relied upon to serve the company to the best of my abilities.
