I think one of my greatest benefits is that I’m not afraid of failing. Therefore, when faced with something new, I give my all. Last year my company started a new type of sales strategy that required a more aggressive approach. Most of the people on my team did not want to change to the new strategy because they thought it would not work. But I decided that it wouldn’t hurt to at least try. Within the first month, my sales more than doubled. And though I made several mistakes along the way, the rewards were most satisfying.

Although it is sometimes very easy to get comfortable in a job and never explore new avenues, I always try to take risks and accept opportunities to develop new skills when they come my way. For example, after about two years of working in the human resources department of a company, my supervisor recommended that I transfer to the sales department. He thought my communication skills were strong enough that I would be successful there. Although I had no formal training in sales techniques, I agreed to take the job. I was forced to work harder and develop new skills in my new position, but in the end I earned valuable experience. I was also very successful, quickly earning multiple promotions and eventually supervising a staff of ten people.
