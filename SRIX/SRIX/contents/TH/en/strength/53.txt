I think constructive criticism is good for working environments.  Though I don’t always agree with the critique, I always take everything into consideration.  I use some and don’t use others, but in the end the customer’s specifications are most important. Listening to other people's suggestions helps improve my thinking processes and contributes to a more perfect work performance.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>

Although many people are adverse to criticism, I try to take most advice I receive into consideration. For example, recently my supervisor gave me a list of suggestions for how to better manage my time at work. Although I always complete my projects on time and turn in high-quality work, she felt there were some ways in which I could improve the use of my time to give myself more room to address potential problems in a project before a deadline. Because of my long record of success at work, I was initially skeptical of her advice, but decided to experiment with some of her suggestions nonetheless. To my surprise, the changes I made led to a much more efficient use of my time, allowing me to complete my work much faster than before. This experience has reinforced my belief that it is always important to be open-minded and willing to accept ideas from others.
