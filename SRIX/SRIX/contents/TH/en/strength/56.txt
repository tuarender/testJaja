<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I am skillful at applying knowledge from the university and experience to my work. For example, I graduated in linguistics. But as a salesperson, I have to adapt my knowledge about languages to my work.  I communicate with customers better than anybody else with my language skills. My success has been caused by my ability to make the most out of my lingual knowledge.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Although my current job as a public relations officer for a small non-profit organization is not directly related to the international relations degree I earned in college, I have been able to utilize the skills and knowledge I learned at school in the workplace. For example, a large part of my curriculum involved strengthening my debating and writing skills. I use these abilities when representing my organization. For example, I was recently involved in creating a new advertising campaign to promote a new piece of legislation my organization supported. In doing this, I was able to take a large amount of complicated information and hone it into a clear, simple, persuasive argument for the public. The project was very similar to projects I had completed in school, although it dealt with a very different topic. Most of my classmates at college have gone on to careers in the government, but by being able to adapt my skills to fit my interests, I have been able to find success in an entirely unrelated field.
