I am very imaginative and creative. Sometimes, especially when I am bored, I imagine myself in a fast-pace environment, forcing me to find more creative ways to finish my tasks.  Doing this ensures that my mind is active. Being creative helps me to be successful by using my unique skills effectively, no matter how tough the obstacles are.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Ever since childhood I have been interested in art, although I never pursued it in any professional sense, today I am able to incorporate my artistic talents in my work. Much of my job involves designing presentations for clients, and in this task I always try to add my own artistic touch. By creating eye-catching, unique presentations, not only do I capture my audience’s interest, I show clients that I am willing to put in extra effort for their project.
