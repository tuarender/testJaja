Everyone knows that in the business world, success is about surviving the strenuous market conditions and edging out the competitors. If you do not follow that rule, your company will not survive. Last year, a new competitor entered the market with a tremendous comparative advantage that almost drove all of the other companies out of business. Knowing that there was no way I could beat them with buying power, I approached them with a merger idea. I knew that I had the experience and key customer relations that they did not. As a result, they went ahead with the idea and while my company has a new name, look and feel, we were able to stay alive in the strenuous market.

Ten years ago I co-founded a small Internet start-up company with a few long-time business partners. Although we enjoyed initial success, after a few years the company was facing severe financial problems. While some of our employees, even one of my business partners, chose to leave the organization at that point, I chose to put in extra work and make whatever sacrifices I needed to in order to keep the company alive. Through quick decision-making, some risk-taking and creative financial maneuvers, I was able to save the company, and it remains successful to this day.
