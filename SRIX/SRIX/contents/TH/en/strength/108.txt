In my opinion, a person’s attitude toward his environment shapes his emotions and thus his behavior. And while I know that not everyone is perfect and not everything goes according to plan, I try my hardest to maintain a good attitude. One time a deal for our biggest account went terrible wrong. We missed the deadline by two weeks and when we showed the client our results they were unsatisfied. To top it off, we spent twice the budgeted amount to produce the product to the client’s specifications. After the ordeal, everyone in the office felt terrible. Some of them even quit, anticipating that the company would go bankrupt. I, on the other hand, decided to keep a good and cheery attitude. It soon spread throughout the company and everyone came together with a positive outlook on the future. Though we didn’t score big that time, I knew that our day would come. I would simply wait for it.

In my sales position, having a winning attitude is very important. When seeking out new clients or working with existing ones, I have to believe that I am going to close the deal and be successful. Having this attitude helps me do my job better. I am more persuasive with my clients and do more to meet their needs because I care more about earning their business.
