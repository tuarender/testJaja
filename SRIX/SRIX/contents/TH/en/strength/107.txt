One thing I am good at is identifying someone’s key strengths and using them for the good of the team. In our most recent product offering, we needed to come up with a state-of-the-art item that still offered user-friendly components. Given the job of building a team to accomplish this goal, I found the people in the company who really specialized in the key development areas of the product. When I brought the five people together, I made sure that they focused on what they were good at, this way the product would be top-notch. After three strenuous weeks of planning and rigid organization, we released the product. When it hit the market, we were the leading seller of that item in the market for three straight quarters.

As the head of the human resources department of my company, there are many times when I am responsible for forming teams within my staff to handle large projects. When doing so, I carefully consider each person’s skill set and personality, so as to ensure that I am putting a group of people together who will not only understand the task I assign them but also be able to work well together in achieving these tasks. So far, I have been successful at this. Each time I have had to form a team, they have completed the project easily, and most of the staff involved has reported that they had a positive experience working with their team.
