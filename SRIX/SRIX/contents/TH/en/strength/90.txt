I place importance on time so as to make the most use of the 24 hours in a single day. For example, in the morning, I arrange my work so I know what to do for the day. Then I follow my schedule. This has proved useful in the past especially in high-stress production situations.  My plan gives me direction and guidance so that I won’t get overwhelmed.  Because of this, I know how to manage my work to make the most use of my time and make my projects move forward smoothly.

In addition to my full-time position as the director public relations at a small industrial company, for the past three years I have served on the board of directors for a growing charity. In this position, I have been responsible for organizing and attending multiple charity events, and also have volunteered a large amount time in fundraising and increasing public awareness of the organization’s cause. It is obviously important for me to make sure that the time I spend on my charity work does not conflict with my job. This can be challenging at times, but by creating time schedules and keeping close track of all my responsibilities for both organizations – essentially, but managing my time well – I have been able to provide high quality work for both my company and my charity.
