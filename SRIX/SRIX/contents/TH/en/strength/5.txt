I believe that the real key to success is in the details. The way an item looks is the initial step in attracting a customer’s attention. Presenting an item in its best light is what I am good at. I was given the task once of presenting information to an evaluation committee, who would determine the rating that our company would receive. I collected data from all over the company and compiled in a easily readable fashion. I also provide minute details that would directly and positively affect our ratings. Although it was hard work, in the end our company received a very high score.

As a sales representative, it is essential for me to have good presentation skills. My ability to attract and maintain clients rests solely on my ability to present the facts about our product line clearly and persuasively. Therefore, my communication and presentation skills are things that I am constantly working on. Before meeting with customers, my colleagues and I will frequently run multiple mock presentations and constantly seek out feedback not only from our superiors but also from our clients themselves. Although I have given the same set of presentations hundreds of times, I recognize the importance of keeping my speeches as perfect as possible. Strengthening my skills as much as possible will help to make my company successful and profitable.
