Discipline, in my opinion, is the key to success. If one is always distracted and doesn’t keep the goal in view he will never achieve his dreams. During my first year at my current company, I set a goal to make fifty thousand dollars in sales each month. It was hard the first month because I was getting used to the atmosphere, but every morning I would envision my goal. After the third month, I reached my goal and sold over sixty thousand dollars worth of product.  Without the discipline of showing up to work early to envision my goal, I would have never reached it.

As an administrative assistant, I must make sure than multiple tasks are accomplished every day before I leave the office. This responsibility requires me to work quickly and stay focused on the task at hand at all time. By staying disciplined in my work, I am able to be successful at it.
