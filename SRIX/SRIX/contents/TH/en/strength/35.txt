<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I believe that one can make decisions and solve problems faster and much more effectively when calm.  When a problem arises I try my best not to panic and I do not take major action until I feel comfortable doing so.  One time a coworker did something to make me angry.  Instead of reacting immediately, I waited until I was at ease.  I later let him know about the situation and he corrected his mistake.  Being calm helps me deal with all situations since the solution comes out only when I am not in a panic.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
For the past five years I have worked in the client services department of a non-profit organization that assists people who have been the victims of fires, flood, earthquakes, or other natural or man-made disasters. My position requires me to work directly with the victims, helping them relocate family members and find temporary shelter, food and clothing directly after their crisis. These are very difficult times for our clients, and I have found that it is essential for me to maintain a sense of calm and peacefulness while I am working with them. This helps our clients calm down themselves, and allows me to gain information and help them in a way that I would not be able to otherwise. I do encounter some stressful and emotional situations through my work, where it is difficult for me to maintain my composure. However, I do my best to stay calm, knowing that my strength will ultimately help our clients.
