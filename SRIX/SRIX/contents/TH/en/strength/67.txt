<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I strive to be number one in everything that I endeavor. During the last major sales push in our department was split into five teams, the team with the most sales would receive an all-expense-paid vacation on the company’s private resort. I wanted that prize really bad, so I motivated my team and worked very hard. I spent hours finding leads and contacting prospects because I wanted the reward and the win. Though, we only received second place, I feel my competitive and self-motivated nature helped the team and my company tremendously.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
I am naturally a very competitive person, and have learned how to use this trait at work to push myself to achieve as much as I can. For example, in my current position as a salesperson, my department sets a specific sales target each month. My coworkers and I look at that target as a challenge, and we tend to compete to see who can meet the sales quota the fastest. This healthy competition encourages me to improve my sales skills. I go out of my way to meet every client’s needs, and also make sure to learn everything I can about our products, so as to make myself a better salesperson. Most months I am one of the first in the department to meet the sales goal. Because of my competitive nature, I am very active and enthusiastic about my work. Once I have set a goal, I will not rest until I have achieved it.
