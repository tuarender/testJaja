<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
The ability to mobilize people is a key part of executing a viable plan. One of my strengths is having the ability to organize and direct people in such a way that will ensure that an activity is running smoothly. At my architecture company we had a project that involved over fifty people working on the same building. I organized the people according to their strengths and establish a communication circuit that would make sure that everyone was on the same page. The project ended very smoothly, in large part, because of my directing ability.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
In my current position I am responsible for directing a number of small projects that require me to communicate with and balance the needs of many different groups of people. For example, I am frequently involved in organizing labor relations fairs at local universities. This involves not only contacting schools, but also finding and scheduling speakers, arranging schedules, and helping to prepare multiple presentations. At all times I have to balance the interests of the university with which I’m working at the time with the interests of my own company and ensure that both institutions benefit from my project. Juggling all of these concerns is a challenge at times, but when I see a fair completed successfully, I know that my efforts have been worthwhile and will be appreciated.
