<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
The thing about myself that I trust most is my intuition. That is the way I judge things. When I was given a project, I went with what makes the most sense. My peers often compliment me, because they never have to give me detailed instruction. I think this helps me quite a bit because I am always on the same page with my co-workers.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Although sometimes common sense is taken as a given trait in people, I have found that it is not always employed when it should be. When I am planning out projects, I always take a step back and ask myself if my assumptions or work so far has been logical, if I’ve followed the right steps or overlooked something important. By taking this simple step, I occasionally find a large error I’ve made and am able to correct it in time. By ensuring that I use common sense in my work, I am more successful in my efforts.
