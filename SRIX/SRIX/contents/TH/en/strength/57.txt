<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
One cannot have success without proper execution. As a project manager, I get plans handed down to me from my supervisor that will help increase my company’s productivity. When I get them, I get started right away. I make sure to utilize any pertinent directions and motivate everyone on the team to stick to the plan as best as possible. When things don’t go as planned, we contact my supervisor for advice on what we should do. This style of implementation has provided me with success on many different projects.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
As an associate public relations officer at my company, much of what I do involves implementing plans designed by my superiors. Whether it is a new advertising campaign or a simple press conference, I am told what message my company would like communicated to the public and am then left to ensure that it happens. In this, I have always been successful in seeing that the company’s needs are met.
