<u><b>Example1</b></u>

Sometimes I take on too many responsibilities. As a result I have become used to delegating some of my work to others. I try to match tasks to the people who are most qualified to complete them. This frees up my time and allows me to tend to my more important responsibilities. In the past, some projects would go unfinished because of my obsession to overwork myself. By delegating responsibilities to others, I am able to capitalize on the skills of others and facilitate projects through to completion, thereby increasing overall performance. Delegating responsibilities contributes to the success of the projects by effectively using the skills of others, dividing the work and increasing the likelihood of on time completion.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Three years ago I was promoted to the head of the public relations department of my firm. In an attempt to show my superiors that I was a capable leader, I initially attempted to control almost every major project in the department. I wanted to meet with every client, edit every media release, and stay up to date on everything my staff was doing. I soon learned, however, that this was not the best way to run my department. I didn’t have time to be involved in every project, and my attempt to do so was slowing down work for my employees. I realized that I had to delegate work to others, and began assigning responsibilities to members of my staff based on their skills. This reorganization significantly increased our productivity and the quality of our work, and it’s as system I’ve followed ever since.
