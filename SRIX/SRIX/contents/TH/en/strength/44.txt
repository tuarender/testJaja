<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I devote myself to produce good work. I am willing to work very late to complete important assignments. In one assignment, I had to check every new employee’s performance each day and then help them to improve. Sometimes I have to work very late to list the weaknesses of each team member and plan how I will help them improve. Being determined and devoted makes me train new employees well, which will in time help my company grow overall.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
For the past two years I have pursued a masters degree in media communications while at the same time continuing my full-time work at the public relations firm where I have been employed for five years. Balancing school with work has not been easy; most days I go directly from work to class, and then stay up most of the night completing required readings and papers. Although it may be difficult, however, I am determined to receive my higher degree and am willing to do whatever it takes to achieve my goal.
