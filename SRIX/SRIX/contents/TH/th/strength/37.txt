<u><b>Example1</b></u>
<br>
I’m a very laid-back and easygoing person. People often recognize me as the peacekeeper in very tense situations.  For example, last year my company created a software development team for a large order. I had a conflicting personality with another person on the team. We would often get into petty fights over insignificant things. Once it became apparent that our behavior was affecting the rest of the team, I sat him down and came to a compromise on the situation. No one wanted to interrupt the two bickering co-workers, so I relented in for the sake of the project.

<u><b>Example2</b></u>
<br>
Many times during my career, I have found myself in the position to negotiate a compromise between competing interests. For example, my company recently instituted a controversial new policy that penalized employees who were late to work by deducting certain amounts from their salary. The move upset many employees. In situations such as these, I always try to take the initiative in finding common ground and bringing a conflict to an end. In an effort to calm the tensions between workers and management, I proposed a new policy that would take into account each employee’s work performance. This compromise was accepted by both sides, and led to a more efficient, peaceful work environment.

<u><b>Example3</b></u>
<br>
I am the one who make compromises for the mutual benefits of the organization and employees. For example, a number of employees disagree with the company's policy about salary deduction for being late to work. So, I proposed to change the policy into the evaluation system to control the work performance of each employee in a more efficient way. My compromise helps put the organization's policy into practice since all the employees agree to follow the rules.
